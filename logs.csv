Professor Thotte,
⚪️,I call bullshit
Tuna,Yeah. That's better
fuccboi,"well it costs $25 each, but I would have to charge sales tax and I expect to have extra inventory so I would want like $4 more so I don't get boned at first. What about something like 3 s, 15m, 20l, 2xl"
Tuna,32 seems high for an order of 50. I don't want you stuck with the charge. I would cancel and reduce 
fuccboi,"So I thought there was going to be a final approval screen before ordering 50 1/4 zips and there wasn't so I accidentally submitted an order. Assuming the design would get approved, should I cancel the order or go through or reduce the quantity? Color is a dark grey, would probably charge ~$32 each"

Sam Pepose,Prolog.
Bradley Faskowitz,"I appreciate all the feedback!  Though it sounds kinda weird, my question deal with programming paradigms specifically and how they can benefit a developing mind, so like object-oriented or functional or declarative or something like that.  Also, this is more speculative rather than concrete."
hoegrammer,"if you're trying to teach in Nashville, I think VSVS has a few Lego programming kits that Pat might be willing to loan out"
hoegrammer,Processing can be pretty fun to start out with and Khan Academy has some good tutorials and a decent environment for beginners
hoegrammer,"if you want to work with robots, scribbler bots are pretty easy to work with and you program them using Python on Calico but they're not cheap"
hoegrammer,"as someone who has taught high schoolers, I wouldn't recommend arduino as fun as it is. Even for older kids it's pretty difficult especially to start out with "
GroupMe,Mark added Alan Samanta to the group.

Bradley Faskowitz,"If you were to teach programming to teenagers in school, probably around 13 years old, which programming paradigm would you teach them first and why? (Object oriented, functional, or other).  Note that most of these people won't end up being computer programmers and the purpose of this is make them better at things generally.  If anyone has any thoughts, would love to hear them through any sort of communication method."

Tuna,Yeah I saw people got gcc working on it and Python lite. 
Max Care,"There's a lot more involved in getting it to work, but it's got a little 80MHz CPU on it. You can even use the arduino language to program it if you're the kind of pleb that is frightened by C. "

🚂🚃🚃🚃🚃🚃,"While the vagina plays a significant role in human and
non-human sexuality, its role with regard to human female sexuality (including
heterosexual and lesbian sexual activity) is especially documented. Less is
known about the vagina of other animals. In human females and a number of other
female mammals, vaginal moisture is increased during sexual arousal by vaginal
lubrication, which reduces friction and allows for smoother penetration of the
vagina during sexual activity. The texture of the vaginal walls create friction
for the penis during sexual intercourse and stimulate it toward ejaculation,
enabling fertilization. In addition, a variety of sexually transmitted
infections (STIs) and other disorders can affect the vagina. Because of the
risk of STIs, safe sex practices are recommended."
mc clanahan,lally serving sass
🚂🚃🚃🚃🚃🚃,"The vagina is a muscular and tubular part of the female
genital tract, which in humans extends from the vulva to the uterus. The outer
vaginal opening may be partly covered by a membrane called the hymen. At the
deep end, the cervix (neck of the uterus) bulges into the vagina. The vagina
allows for sexual intercourse and childbirth, and channels menstrual flow,
which occurs periodically as part of the menstrual cycle."

🚂🚃🚃🚃🚃🚃,Eh students make shirts with vandy on them all the time 
Mark,"I know that would step into trademark issues but there might be an issue with ""vanderbilt"" as well "
Mark,Can we put the oak leaf on it
Mark,Also it should say isis supporters instead of vandy cs
GroupMe,Tuna changed the topic to: Hoodies or 1/4 Zip
Mark,Yeah but classy is sassy
Tuna,"Keep in mind. It'll be printed, not embroidered. Which may look better on the hoodie."
Tuna,Like this for hoodie!
Tuna,Like this for quarter zip!
fuccboi,Bonus of a hoodie is the ability to be in shell mode
Tuna,"s classy, but hoodie can do shell mode..."
Tuna,Ok. Jeff and I are looking into the CS stuff. We're gonna poll between quarter zip and lightweight hoodie (think microsoft hoodie). Quarter-zip'
mc clanahan,call him out
Taylor Beck,"A kid giving a presentation in my class just mentioned ""a hacker named 4chan"""
DrRacket,Black with neon green lettering. Like what I've looked at way too much this year
Mark,But heather gray is swanky af
hoegrammer,yo black quarter zips tho. you can spill tons of monster and coffee and no one will ever know!!!
Mark,Put it in gold too
Mark,"Classy. Not across the whole chest, just top right or left or whatever"
Mark,That's what I'm saying
mc clanahan,so like the opposite of vanderbilt cs
eUNIX,Hmmm...can we make it collegiate but also classy so that well wear it after graduating?
fuccboi,i say heather gray with patch in the top right
fuccboi,you want something across the whole chest or just in the top right?
Mark,Very collegiate. And a nice color.

mc clanahan,stfu max you made a robot
Max Care,Is fine. 
Max Care,I didn't take 212 and algorithms was fine. 
Paul Gelston Murray,"212 with spinrad is actually really helpful for algorithms, but I don't think he's taught it since my sophomore year"
⚪️,aka absolutely nothing
⚪️,"[xyz] | ~<>^ •]%| = 7
What I remember from 212"
I have a LISP,Not helpful in the slightest 
Tuna,Technically yes but it didn't help me at all. 
Tuna,No. 
mc clanahan,helps but not completely necessary. it's a prereq but you can get a form
Danny Carr,Do you need 212 for algorithms
mc clanahan,"roth just said ""thank you, sir"" when I turned in my survey and I feel so fuckin classy"
mc clanahan,"""I hope to get some WOW out of you at some point"" -- roth's pickup line, probably"
Mitchell,@hoegrammer what kind of website

DrRacket,Do we have algos today?
mc clanahan,literally impossible
⚪️,Lol no

Mitchell,"Touche, sir"
Mitchell,At first I thought you misspelled probably
eUNIX, What is it?!! Do tell 
mc clanahan,props to @Mitchell  for making the provably best pun i've ever heard though
mc clanahan,this is stupid
mc clanahan,the entire ai class just died at a joke about first order logic
fuccboi,Fuck emacs
mc clanahan,it's called emacs
mc clanahan,been around since the 80s
mc clanahan,support for a ton of languages
mc clanahan,"has a package manager, opens huge files fast"
mc clanahan,no there's this open source version of sublime already
I have a LISP,And struggled with multiple tabs
I have a LISP,Last I heard it couldn't open large files
I have a LISP,Can it open files yet?
Tuna,"ooh, atom's sexy"
fuccboi,There's atom
Tuna,You think there's a way someone could raise money to buy sublime text and make it opensource? like kickstarter or sumfin
mc clanahan,unless you have a free few hours/days
mc clanahan,don't fuck with your boot config
mc clanahan,duh
Tuna,I kept the old one.
Tuna,kinda want to 3way merge...
Tuna,that's what I was thinking.
mc clanahan,just leave the current one
Max Care,Three way merge. 
mc clanahan,assuming you've googled this and haven't found anything
Max Care,Live dangerously
mc clanahan,hmm wait amazon may have fucked with it
mc clanahan,if not then just accept the new one
mc clanahan,have you modified the boot config at all?
🚂🚃🚃🚃🚃🚃,Probably related to Linux

Mitchell,But I also like watching netflix
Mitchell,I mean I like breaking codes as much as the next guy
🚂🚃🚃🚃🚃🚃,Where's the fun in that m 
🚂🚃🚃🚃🚃🚃,"Doubt he would, its just cheating "
Mitchell,@🚂🚃🚃🚃🚃🚃 couldn't we just use an online solver? How would he know the difference
mc clanahan,that's why my ankles are so strong
mc clanahan,I skip everything
🚂🚃🚃🚃🚃🚃,Guess you skipped that prereq too huh Danny 
mc clanahan,I can't read that's why I failed pl
Sam Pepose,@mc clanahan  at least I can read :'(

Sam Pepose,I heard cog studies is really cool
mc clanahan,10/10
mc clanahan,awful pun
eUNIX,"No se chico. --> apparently the do. 

Don't ""bash"" on cog studies. "
Bradley Faskowitz,"Yes, we have class"
mc clanahan,also I thought @mentions disregard mute
mc clanahan,it's cog studies if you're going to class you're doing it wrong
eUNIX,Jk. He has this muted. 
eUNIX,@Bradley Faskowitz Do we have cog studies class tomorrow?

You can pitch a project that you're interested in and allow people to join you (I recommend limiting your group to 1-2 people).

You can pitch yourself and allow an underclassmen to join you, pitch an idea to you, and then help them with their project - provide input, code a little bit, make architectural decisions. 

We strongly encourage the second option for upperclassmen who want to be involved, but don't have any projects they're dying to work on (this is what I'm doing).

Also there will be free chipotle!"

John Lally,Hi friends I lost the algorithms worksheet SOS
Mark,I wanna go to tribunal
I have a LISP,@hoegrammer I agree with that and would also like to add another layer of complexity - that they also have to consider the possibility that allegations are false. My understanding is that the debate is still current regarding fostering a culture of reporting but also validating the reports so that no one innocent gets screwed. 
Tuna,Does anyone know can I query a host centric MySQL db as not local host ?
hoegrammer,"the increase SA VUPD reports out to students is a combination of effects of national politics and the university trying to figure out how to handle out reporting and investigation. Vanderbilt's still under Title IX investigation for mishandling SA cases (along with more than 100 other colleges). The school is trying to institute a ""culture of reporting"" which gets really complicated when you consider how fuckin terribly the EAD handles investigations, how the university has an incentive to keep numbers low, how disciplined perpetrators are much more likely to sue than survivors who don't get justice, and how there isn't really a transparent way for survivors to seek after-the-fact resources without filing a report (for example, everyone at Project Safe is a mandated reporter)"
Mark,"Hide yo kids, hide yo wife"
A.L.A.N,For real tho.... I wonder if it's just a cascade of reports? Like one person reported theirs and other people realized they could/should follow suit kinda thing? 
I have a LISP,What's with all the sexual assault on campus lately? That's not chill
I have a LISP,Start up idea?
Mark,Danny that's brilliant!
mc clanahan,distribute computations over billions of human minds
mc clanahan,use the latino as a development platform
mc clanahan,no dude it's a biomedical class

A.L.A.N,Week from today I believe 
Mark,AI: when is project 3 due?
Mitchell,95
mc clanahan,the 20% was from the times he didn't even go

mc clanahan,@Mitchell  what was the percentage of time you slept during your office hours when you did 282
Matt Lee,...im taking the class. can i pull a mitchell and ta too?
Tuna,Has anyone taken networks or mobile networks that would like to ta next semester? Sallai needs 1 more person.

mc clanahan,someone's intestines exploded in there
Mark,Sorry �
mc clanahan,holy shit guys do NOT go in the fgh bathroom in the back it's literally covered in shit
Breakfast Team Captain,^make 205 great again
eUNIX,@mc clanahan Maybe ask him when his birthday is? And then we can bake him a vegan cake? #BRUCE2016
eUNIX,"Y'all, take topology. If for no other reason than to see this beautiful honey vegan man called Bruce Hughes. "
eUNIX,BRUUUUUCE !
mc clanahan,"he's wearing a shirt right now that says ""thank honeybees"""
mc clanahan,what an adorable human being
mc clanahan,@Eunice Jun bruce is super vegan he went on a rant today about it in class and everyone kept asking him questions cause they're all super conservative
GroupMe,Eunice Jun changed name to eUNIX
fuccboi,Probably getting pub
Matt Lee,danny why arent you in graph class
GroupMe,Emma Birdsong changed name to Professor Thotte
mc clanahan,yeah I got pretty thoroughly wrecked
Mitchell,"I love how he called you out on being late, tho"
Mark,It's called TETRis
Mark,"Damn danny, be a little humbler"

mc clanahan,you kill me
Eunice Jun,@mc clanahan It's all open to interpretation...or compilation ;)
mc clanahan,yes

Mitchell,Lol look what Eric found: http://www.twitch.tv/twitchinstallsarchlinux
Eunice Jun,Do not disparage Python! It makes virtual reality possible!! 
Tuna,you can. i did
Ellis Brown,Yeah I think you can
Mitchell,does anyone know if I can live on campus as a part-time student?
mc clanahan,no but I'm writing ocaml so I might as well be
Mitchell,Danny are you still drunk
mc clanahan,mitchell my programming language dick is five times as big as yours
Mark,Yeah but Mitchell the thing about artificial intelligence is its not actually smart
Mitchell,AI uses Python all the time
Mitchell,"Scientific computing is mostly python, if it's not R or Matlab"
Mitchell,Whole industries like Python
Mark,"But Eugene likes python, danny"
Mitchell,Do not scorn the creators of Python
Mitchell,"Danny, language design is a complex and difficult thing"
mc clanahan,mark you can't just switch to js but it's one of the things python makes you deal with that really shouldn't be that hard
mc clanahan,damn right
Tuna,War is hell
Mark,Thanks for the find Mitchell!  Tuples are hell
Mark,You can't just switch to javascript
mc clanahan,or y'know you could just use javascript and return objects instead of tuples like we're still writing c
mc clanahan,I also read hacker news
Mitchell,Ive been looking for this https://python-programming.courses/pythonic/improving-your-code-readability-with-namedtuples/
mc clanahan,mine are just people asking if I'm colorblind
hoegrammer,you've heard them all
hoegrammer,that's it
hoegrammer,all of my party stories are just hiding in people's rooms to avoid crowds and pulling people away from creeps
mc clanahan,ugh tell me more of your crazy party stories
hoegrammer,maybe? I think I left after. but I also spent a good chunk of time holed up in Megan's room ahahah 
John Lally,@hoegrammer  Did you leave before midnight? I was yelling for you but you were MIA 
hoegrammer,unless that was after I left for sparkman's
hoegrammer,@John Lally  where was I for this picture? also that party definitely had at least one japanese girl (me)
mc clanahan,mitchell I heard there were bitches at your party
A.L.A.N,Way to provide context Mitchell. What party is yours? 
Mitchell,Different party

Mitchell,It goes till 1030
Matt Lee,when does it go to / is it tomorrow too?
Mitchell,It's actually pretty cool
Mitchell,Yo you guys should come to the Japanese haunted house at mctyeire 
Tuna,That was at 103. Sounds like @I have a LISP 
Tuna,😂

A.L.A.N,Get drunk 
A.L.A.N,Ok guys 
Garrett Hoffman,Wtf that would've been so helpful. I got an argument error and it just pointed to a line with 12 function calls. 
mc clanahan,no clue why that's not on by default
mc clanahan,and it gives you a stack trace for errors
mc clanahan,I think you just (require errortrace)
mc clanahan,there is a stacktracing library
mc clanahan,sorry eunice
mc clanahan,lol

Mitchell,"""I'm probably gonna run it once and pass all the tests"""

Eunice Jun,"I figured that out. But I wasn't sure how/where. the error was coming up in the code provided, so I tried back tracing mine to no avail."
mc clanahan,that means you're sending in a non-list to car
A.L.A.N,Fuck sobriety 
mc clanahan,oops
Eunice Jun,Does anyone get an eval-Exp car contract violation error?
mc clanahan,rt
John Lally,Sounds like a metaphor for Vanderbilt. You get spit out the other end smaller and in pieces

mc clanahan,chewed me up and spit me out
A.L.A.N,Did Emma use you too? 
mc clanahan,I am an if statement
Emma Birdsong,I used an if statement in one
Eunice Jun,Part 3
Emma Birdsong,Are you talking about part 3 or part4?
Eunice Jun,"For 270 when we implement our functions, can we use non MUPL constructs? Such as if statements?"
John Lally,Blackout or back out 
A.L.A.N,God I'd die. But its ok cuz 💙
Emma Birdsong,*brings a handle to cryptography* 
A.L.A.N,I'm thinking of starting a help service where I charge a shot every time I help someone

mc clanahan,like same lectures n shit
mc clanahan,they are the same course otherwise
mc clanahan,machine learning is harder than project in ai and isn't open to undergrads

mc clanahan,I'm emailing the ta though lol
mc clanahan,can I see your code though I wanna know what he considers fast
mc clanahan,ok mitchell those are all pretty bad

mc clanahan,would have thought that'd clinch it
mc clanahan,yeah but i also used the visitor pattern to abstract and encapsulate access to the virtual destructor singleton
Sam Pepose,"You used mementos with an abstract strategy list, right?"
mc clanahan,like i'm sorry i didn't realize this was cs 251
mc clanahan,also he takes points off for style?
mc clanahan,let's talk about the cs 270 assignment where i got points off for efficiency when mine runs 10x faster than roths
mc clanahan,i'll start in a few hours maybe
mc clanahan,i haven't started idk
A.L.A.N,Cuz like cleaning each object is different so how do you make general schema 
A.L.A.N,I can't figure out what kind of actions to make

Mark,I'm pretty sure graph theory is just marriage and orgy planning
mc clanahan,you'd probs wanna talk to him to see if that'll result in you getting fucked though
mc clanahan,idk like since it's mostly gonna be machine learning you could defs ask him to waive it
mc clanahan,oh lol you said that
I have a LISP,@mc clanahan Project has ai as a pre req
mc clanahan,a helpful ta??? never heard of that before
Mark,Our ta was helpful though. ..
Mark,They weren't too bad though 
Mitchell,Wait I thought we had quizzes in networks
A.L.A.N,Nice thanks
mc clanahan,nice
mc clanahan,!!!!!
Mark,@A.L.A.N no tests. Easy quizzes. Cool projects. And you get to choose your final project
mc clanahan,@I have a LISP  why can't you take project again?
mc clanahan,sallai is rad 4 sure
mc clanahan,nice ok i have an ee friend who's considering it
A.L.A.N,How not hard? Slash how much work? 
Mark,Networks with Sallai was not hard and he's the bomb and it was practical 
I have a LISP,Dang it I want to take project sooooo badly
mc clanahan,is networks hard
mc clanahan,"yeah vorobeychik said the lectures are the same course, but project in a i has a cool very open-ended project for half the course"
I have a LISP,FYI ai project and machine learning are the same course
Emma Birdsong,"Good thing he wasn't wearing neon today, that would've been too risky. "
Matt Lee,"just wanted to tell everyone that danny just left class, went to the pub, and walked back in 20 minutes later like nothing happened."
Sam Pepose,Ya but he made it up to us during comicbook story time
Mark,"Classic roth, always downing us"
mc clanahan,guys remember when roth told us all we had shitty work ethics and wouldn't survive in the real world
A.L.A.N,Shout out to Mitchell for anonymously quoting me on yik yak 
Mark,Nonlinear optimization is offered and it's the same professor. Mark ellingham is great
fuccboi,Damn otte is harsh
fuccboi,
⚪️,Has anyone taken Intro to Mathematical Logic with Matthew Moore? Linear Optimization isn't offered next semester
mc clanahan,*if you want a good reason to kill yourself
mc clanahan,take 6311 from spinrad
Sam Pepose,Graph theory makes me cry and question our secession from Britain
Mark,Graph theory is not pretty easy.
Mark,Linear optimization is pretty easy
⚪️,Anyone have suggestions on a good/easy math class?
mc clanahan,google xorg multiseat
Tuna,Two cursors would be pretty nice
Taylor Beck,sometimes I hook up two mice at once for maximum speed and control
fuccboi,Honestly the mouse is the future
mc clanahan,nice
I have a LISP,I'm looking into removing my keyboard entirely. It'll leave more room on my MacBook for the mouse.
I have a LISP,I just don't see why you need anything other than a mouse
Mitchell,I use spacemacs now
A.L.A.N,I mean have you used eclipse? Talk about gold standard for IDEs
I have a LISP,I heard its being discontinued because eclipse
A.L.A.N,"Emacs is a pretty crap program, I doubt anyone here uses it "
I have a LISP,If there's someone at our school you should lmk
I have a LISP,I don't know anyone who uses emacs
Tuna,Can someone do a pimp my emacs session tomorrow since there's no adv programming?
⚪️,"If you're talking about the openstack stuff, its in powerpoint 4"
Tuna,where's the list of everything we need to install?
Tuna,ssh -i /path/to/key.pem ubuntu@floatingip
⚪️,It was like 2 months ago that we did this. We have everything set up but are having trouble. It was something like ssh -something Ubuntu@ipaddress
Mark,Fuckin savage
A.L.A.N,(You need a floating IP) 
A.L.A.N,Pay attention in class? 
⚪️,Anyone know how to ssh into the cloud vm for cloud computing?
⚪️,"http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QzgquM7NQIc

mc clanahan,lol ml and ai are only nildly related
Mark,It's grad and yes I think so
Tuna,I emailed Eugene to ask if I could
I have a LISP,They're offering machine learning? Does that require ai as a prerequisite too?
I have a LISP,Ugh I should've taken ai this semester. Want to take project in ai so badly
mc clanahan,@I have a LISP  I'm taking project in ai and maybe ml?
mc clanahan,"sorry for not winking back at you @Sam Pepose , too busy thinking about wanting to sleep"
Mitchell,None
I have a LISP,What cs classes are people taking next semester
Tuna,FYI. I'm pretty sure the 3892 special topic taught by Daniel is Big Data and not also Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Sys De
Mark, 1 to 3
Mitchell,yo can someone tell me when schmidt's office hours are
mc clanahan,@DrRacket  getting pumped i see
GroupMe,Henry Bogardus changed name to DrRacket
mc clanahan,yours too
mc clanahan,*edgy
mc clanahan,thanks I'm going for edy tech asshole
Emma Birdsong,Your hair looks gr9
mc clanahan,feeling the otte vibes on fall break
I have a LISP,Haskell says I should go to the library instead of the bar.... Typical Haskell
mc clanahan,we could do some distributed ai shit
mc clanahan,join us
mc clanahan,you'd be good at it
mc clanahan,poss lol
Tuna,Think I could get into so projects without ai? I wanna and I'm a quick learner and whatever...
mc clanahan,red bulls are $2 a pack in illinois
mc clanahan,i'm so fucked up right now
Mitchell,^implying not already fucked up
mc clanahan,i'm taking literally all intense meche courses next sem and i'm gonna get fucked up
mc clanahan,haha rad
Mitchell,I just happened to get ensnared by it and found out it actually fulfilled the rec
Mitchell,Tru^
mc clanahan,i get that there's 282 but i refuse to entertain that monstrosity of an attempt at education
mc clanahan,"and yeah mitchell you're right but like there's no ""project in operating systems"" or ""project in compilers"" since compilers is MIA so ai is almost as cool"
mc clanahan,that's basically what i've heard
mc clanahan,@John Lally  thinking of taking it next sem so can finish up cs and focus on the 23 hours i have left to take for meche
Mitchell,Intro to computer graphics counts
Mitchell,CS 282 counts
Mitchell,Yeah not just the ones with project in the name
Mark,Computer networks counts
A.L.A.N,I had to do a paper. And that's it 
A.L.A.N,LOL get rekt 
Mitchell,Wait danny a lot of classes actually count for the project course
A.L.A.N,Wait john my computer ethics class was great. Like my professor just didn't give a fuck. Also a super cool guy like I'm going to eat at his house tonight and then go bar hopping together 
John Lally,6 presentations 6 papers 6 quizzes and a final project is too much for 100 level bs class 
Mark,If anything it made m e less ethical
John Lally,@mc clanahan Are you also in ethics because computers and ethics is officially the worst class I have taken at Vanderbilt I hate it more than anything 
mc clanahan,myers is the man tho
mc clanahan,also fuck cs ethics
mc clanahan,@Max Care  let's get turnt w/ eugene
mc clanahan,yeah i'm gonna do project in ai
Mark,Eugene is the man. You're going to do whatever you want regardless danny
mc clanahan,thinkin bout project in ai cause vorobeychik is baller but i've heard software engineering you can basically do whatever you want
mc clanahan,finna finish up my cs curric
mc clanahan,what's the move for project courses next sem
mc clanahan, oh shit thanks for reminding me
A.L.A.N,Yeah 
Mitchell,"Hey for AI, you only have to submit once per team, right?"
mc clanahan,groupme.p-mcg.com
A.L.A.N,What's the URL for the groupme analytics site again?
⚪️,Sorry y'all I'm feeling nostalgic
GroupMe,⚪️ changed the group's avatar
fuccboi,19.1075% getting close
Matt Lee,dannys just trying to be over 20% on groupme stats right now
mc clanahan,B)
mc clanahan,wait shit
mc clanahan,:B
Tuna,"Guys, Mitchell? So sick. "
mc clanahan,"one person fucks their own family, so it's even more recursive! "
mc clanahan,"for example, game of thrones draws a lot of inspiration from lisp"
⚪️,That's some Jeffrey Dahmer shit
mc clanahan,and lisp still actually has effects today even if we don't use lisp itself
mc clanahan,you can actually fuck an entire family in a single function
mc clanahan,"so you fuck the head, then its parents, and so on"
Mark,Right
mc clanahan,"a list is like a flat tree, right"
mc clanahan,it's super cool actually cause it's all recursive
mc clanahan,this led of course to the free love movement of the 60s
mc clanahan,cause it's all ~homiconic~
mc clanahan,yeah and lisp was developed so you can fuck a function too
Mitchell,"wait, literally or figuratively"
mc clanahan,roth demonstrated on the board
mc clanahan,we learned how to fuck a list today
Mark,Mitchells sick guys �
Mitchell,both literally and figuratively
Mitchell,yo how was class i missed it cuz i'm sick
Garrett Hoffman,Lol immediate regret 
mc clanahan,big move @Garrett Hoffman  contradicting roth to his face
I have a LISP,

A.L.A.N,Yeah but I was waiting for an email
mc clanahan,i know you're a wriggler
mc clanahan,can't wriggle outta this one alan
mc clanahan,if you were trying to work then just mute your entire phone
A.L.A.N,I don't usually there was just spam when I was trying to work. And groupme doesn't have mute for an hour like Facebook 
mc clanahan,isis gang or die

Mark,One that won't fit in a pocket
mc clanahan,I have small ones no mags
mc clanahan,how good is good
Mark,Does anyone have a good flash light?
Mitchell,PSA: Danny McClanahan is a leech
Tuna,Anyone have a cooler we could use for punch?
Gross,Presence or presents 
Mark,She's really lame and sappy
Mark,She said your presence is all she wants for her birthday
Matt Lee,crap i forgot to get a gift for mouse cop

Sam Pepose,"No, mark. We are not a hate group. We merely provide a path to the Truth. Linus is the Almighty. In Vim We Trust."
Mark,All Hail the Almighty Vim!

A.L.A.N,Don't think so 
Tuna,ok. cool. what about resource mgmt
A.L.A.N,Just xen and virtualization
A.L.A.N,No
Tuna,"Virtualization, Xen, anything else? His grad student's work?"
Tuna,What's it on?
A.L.A.N,Yes 
Tuna,Oh fuck. We have a quiz in cloud don't we
Tim Becker,🙌
Garrett Hoffman,We do not 
Ellis Brown,"Anyone in OS, do we have a quiz??"
I have a LISP,Anyone want to see We Were Promise Jetpacks on December 2 at exit in?
Mark,"When he/she asks you out, even though a chill may run down your tundra and you can't stop your poops from slaughtering, just play it tubular. Take a long pause before answering in a very grubby voice. I'll have to defenestrate it over."
Mark,"How to get the coolest guy/girl in school to date you:       It's simple. Turn the butts. Make him/her want swimmingly to date you. Make sure you're always dressed to run. Each and every day, wear a thong that you know shows off your big toenail to sultry advantage and make your frog look like a million motherfuckers. Even if the two of you make meaningful cunt contact, don't admit it. No hugs or pugs. Just shake his/her dick firmly. And remember"
A.L.A.N,Frog
Mark,Ok an another noun?
A.L.A.N,Big toenail
Mark,Ok what about a body part
A.L.A.N,Butts
Mark,Guys I need a plural noun
AJ,hopefully no
AJ,Chapter 10
Mark,I doubt we'll have a quiz
mc clanahan,idk
A.L.A.N,What is it? 
mc clanahan,probably
A.L.A.N,AI people is there assigned reading for tomorrow? 
A.L.A.N,I love his stories I think they help break up the constant focus and thinking with some fun 
Emma Birdsong,"My favorite was ""my daughter's job when she's at home is to tell me if I've put my clothes on inside out"""
Mitchell,"And I was like, ""do you ever wonder why she doesn't come home?"""
Mitchell,"Lol last year before he did that he was like, ""my daughter hardly ever comes home, so in honor of her visiting I'm going to read her blog to you"""
John Lally,"Personally I was so distracted by his dramatic reading of his daughter's ""satirical graphic fan fiction"" shit that I lost that whole lecture "
Mark,"Damned if he does, damned if he doesn't "
Luke Kornet,It's only when tests come around that I wish Spinrad didn't spend 1/2 the class setting up jokes
Ellis Brown,Anyone have the answers to the sample midterm from algos?
Emma Birdsong,@Ellis Brown Idk if you're still in need of this but the first answer helped me understand dynamic vs static scoping http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19461503/dynamic-and-static-scoping-program-differences
mc clanahan,power move if I've ever seen one
mc clanahan,this freshman just camw in to fgh at 2:30 and proceeded to do homework
hoegrammer,omg
fuccboi,Haters gonna hate
Ellis Brown,Anyone have any sort of clue how the static scoping works? The dynamic makes sense
mc clanahan,sorry @Tuna 
mc clanahan,we're gonna kick everyone out
Tuna,No More!
GroupMe,Big Steve changed name to Steven Ayanruoh
Breakfast Team Captain,"Congrats to big steve, 50th member you win an unlimited supply of notifications about classes you might or might not be taking"

Henry Bogardus,If anyone knows how to do 3b here lemme know
Mark,No I love you :(
fuccboi,Good. Everybody stay here or I'll never see you again after this semester.
Mark,Ooh ooh me me!
Breakfast Team Captain,Has anyone applied to study abroad and not heard back yet? 
mc clanahan,"@Gross I checked, couldn't see anything"
Mark,I pulled some strings �
A.L.A.N,Wait mark isn't 250 a prerequisite for AI? 
Mark,WHO CARES ABOUT TESTS WHEN LIFE IS ON THE LINE
⚪️,"For a test you would really just have to draw it or say ""rightmost/last element"" Implementing one would be a bit different."
Mark,Do you keep track of where the rightmost leaf is
⚪️,@Mark this is a pretty good visualization of adding something to a heap
Gross,I might have left my notebook in the 212 room/ VandyApps room and if someone is there and can check for me that would be amazing 
Gross,Is anyone in featheringill right now?
A.L.A.N,"Add bottom level, furthest left "
Mark,How do you ensure completeness of the binary tree?
A.L.A.N,Basically promote the child that keeps it a heap (parent bigger or smaller than kids) 
A.L.A.N,So that it stays a heap. If its a min heap then promote 7 
A.L.A.N,For a max heap 
A.L.A.N,Promote 8 
Mark,Say root is 20 and has left subtree starting at 8 and right subtree starting at 7
Mark,How do you choose which subtree to bubble down to?
⚪️,"Heap sort you just pull off the root node, then move the last leaf up to the top and bubble it down. Repeat until it's empty"
⚪️,"Heaps are just messy binary trees. A parent node is always less than the it's children. Heaps are also complete, so every node has two children, at least until the leaves, which can be incomplete if there aren't enough nodes "
hoegrammer,anyone wanna study plz
hoegrammer,i don't get heaps....
Henry Bogardus,for union-find with kruskals

Mark,What did we use union find for? Just kruskull?
Max Care,I hope so. I sorta get heaps. Union-find though...
Tuna,ARE HEAPS ON THE ALGORITHMS EXAM?
mc clanahan,you're not
Emma Birdsong,It's not
Sam Carlson,Anyone know if coursera week 3 is on the PL exam
mc clanahan,obviously you haven't been taking enough meth
Mitchell,"Besides, meth doesn't even kill you"
mc clanahan,not if I'm dead
Mark,Get in line bub
Mitchell,Wait you gotta take ai first
mc clanahan,anyone have some meth? just failed an fb interview and wanna die
A.L.A.N,The second paragraph is literally copy paste what he said the tests were like 
Mitchell,Rephrase 
Mitchell,What
A.L.A.N,"AI people: my friend who took the class said that
There's quite a bit of applying the algorithms and other stuff similar to that on the test "
mc clanahan,i just woke up and haven't started ai
Mitchell,wait why
mc clanahan,@Mitchell fuk u
Mark,Not me
Mitchell,are you guys in fgh
Mitchell,dammit I should have paid attention during that review

AJ,Yes
Mitchell,AJ are you even in that class
GroupMe,AJ Ballway changed name to AJ
AJ Ballway,induction
Mitchell,wait how do i deal with time
Mitchell,thanks
Mitchell,yeah that sounds right
Mark,Well you convert the FOL to CNF and that keeps the variables but gets rid of quantifiers I think and then you substitute Marcus in for x when you need to
Mitchell,substitution?
⚪️,^^
Mark,I converted them to first order logic and then did substitution and then did resolution
Mitchell,"Also for question 1 on AI, are we supposed to convert each sentence to propositional logic first and then do resolution?"
Ellis Brown,Does the proglang test on Wednesday cover section 3 of the videos?
Tuna,Looking at you
Tuna,@Gross 
Mark,I second that 
Tuna,Pls
Tuna,Can someone do a pimp my emacs night? I'd rather someone teach me than sift through the piles of documentation. 
⚪️,Yep
Mitchell,Just up to propositional?
Mitchell,"Hey so AI doesn't cover first order logic, right?"
I have a LISP,Heck yeah VandyApps does and capital one is ordering us a bunch more
mc clanahan,RUN THEM JEWELS FAST
fuccboi,Anybody at the rtj concert?
Mark,Vandyapps does and there's a pdf online
Tuna,@Megan Woodruff 
⚪️,By the way does anyone have a copy of Cracking the Coding Interview I could borrow through next Tuesday?
Mark,Where is everyone
⚪️,Or maybe that's just me
⚪️,Recreate the North 5 stash in Jacobs Believed in Me so we can cry about how are parents never believed in us
Breakfast Team Captain,Taking a cue from commons' strategy?
Max Care,We could keep stashes above multiple tiles so if people are by one we can get at the other. 
mc clanahan,we're discussing ceiling tiles
Breakfast Team Captain,Glad to continue the tradition of getting drunk in fgh
Tuna,Yes! In 226 maybe
John Lally,Please I need this. 
A.L.A.N,Me to 
Max Care,I would too.
Emma Birdsong,I would contribute
fuccboi,Danny and I formally propose making a featheringill alcohol stash.

A.L.A.N,Where you at? 
Max Care,I'm going to be in fgh all night if any people in AI want to get together and study and/or cry.

Tuna,That's my POA
mc clanahan,sobbing loudly
hoegrammer,y'all how does one go about studying for algorithms

Breakfast Team Captain,If you want more info talk to me/ethan
Breakfast Team Captain,Hey guys just an fyi that bny mellon is having an info session for tech people 5-6pm tomorrow! I know its not like a google/microsoft name but i worked there over the summer and learned so much more than i thought I would and they take interns really seriously

A.L.A.N,I'm talking about hw2 
A.L.A.N,People in AI any idea how to do question 1? Like do we transform it into propositional logic somehow or what? 
Tuna,Right
Henry Bogardus,But there's no way he's asking if g' is a minimum spanning tree of g' right?
Mark,I was going to ask tomorrow what he meant by that
Mark,Wednesday
Max Care,Is that due tomorrow?
Henry Bogardus,"Hey people in algorithms, for number 2, does he mean ""will T necessarily be a min spanning tree for G'?"" Instead of ""will G' necessarily be a min spanning tree for G'?"""
A.L.A.N,YESSSS BUT ALSO NO 
Max Care,"I propose ""The Carol Swain School of Engineering"""
hoegrammer,you could do that with trap house
A.L.A.N,It'll be great 
A.L.A.N,Then we start a rumor with the freshman that its the place to get weed and we have lots of freshman wandering around looking for weed 
A.L.A.N,Building 420 
hoegrammer,"what about ""trap house"""
mc clanahan,I propose lord voldemort
Tuna,"Ok. Proposal, we should determine what we're going to call the new engineering building before they name it so we can spread it around and have everyone call it by the wrong name. I suggest ""Blayre"" just for added confusion. "
Tuna,We should make a commonapp for applying to internships.

A.L.A.N,I didn't do the assignments
mc clanahan,that doesn't make sense

A.L.A.N,I never did 
mc clanahan,you have to make an assignments array
⚪️,"Ai people, how do you assign a color to a node?"
mc clanahan,I interviewed for msoft in a sweatshirt
⚪️,Probably not
A.L.A.N,Are software companies going to care if I'm in a sport coat ? 
⚪️,"@Ellis Brown Depends on who you want to talk to. If you're going for companies that do primarily software (e.g. Microsoft, Epic, etc.) just wear khaki shorts or jeans and a decent shirt because the people you're talking to expect you to be wearing either that ot what Mitchell just said. If you're looking at companies that aren't software based, you pretty much need to wear a suit or sports coat"
Mitchell,"And one of those ""Make America Great Again"" snapbacks"
Mitchell,And a ripped t-shirt with mustard on it
Mitchell,Imma wear sweatpants
Tuna,CS isn't as big of a deal to wear a suit
fuccboi,"@Ellis Brown most people wear suit, or at least a button down and tie"
Emma Birdsong,^microsoft goes pretty fucking hard
Max Care,"""Last time I blacked out, I woke up at my desk, on my computer"" - Danny McClanahan"
Ellis Brown,Anyone know what the dress code is for the career fair tomorrow??
John Lally,God bless 
Mitchell,So I've never told you guys this but I'm actually a sophomore. I tell people I'm only graduating a year and a half early so I don't seem pretentious. 
A.L.A.N,Me. I'm a freshman 
fuccboi,Are there any freshmen/sophomores in this group? Please tell me no.
hoegrammer,my friend like to have cinnawaffle nights https://v.groupme.com/13238999/2015-09-23T15:43:59Z/262a8c1a.224x128r90.mp4
hoegrammer,... downside?
Max Care,I need to get a waffle maker at some point. The downside though would be that I would then exclusively eat waffles. 
A.L.A.N,Use Otte's
hoegrammer,well ya done fucked then
Tuna,I dont have a waffle machine :(
Tuna,OMG!
hoegrammer,would recommend v delicious also incredibly easy
hoegrammer,ps @Tuna have you ever stuck the cinnamon roll dough in a waffle machine
Tuna,I'd leave that up.
Breakfast Team Captain,I once got endorsed on linkedin for making coffee i mean yea i took it down but just saying i have the skills necessary
A.L.A.N,I'm just a failure at delicate 😭😭
hoegrammer,can I advertise myself as a coffee-fetching intern? I make a mean latte
A.L.A.N,I did add vinegar 
Emma Birdsong,So the Google doodle is looking real sexual today
Breakfast Team Captain,Add a few drops of vinegar to the water
Tuna,Im with you alan
hoegrammer,hella aggressive. you need delicate womanly hands
A.L.A.N,Then I bought pots and it was all ok 
A.L.A.N,When I did it anyway 
A.L.A.N,It came apart in the water 
hoegrammer,then again I burn toast on the reg so that doesn't really mean much
hoegrammer,I burn toast way more frequently than I fuck up a poached egg
hoegrammer,on the real tho how do you fuck up a poached egg other than over/undercooking it or just cracking the yolk entirely
Tuna,cooking cinnamon rolls rn!!!
Tuna,:(
hoegrammer,just totally failed a coding interview but it's ok because I had a poached egg on toast for breakfast so I have that going for me
fuccboi,I would too
Tuna,i would
A.L.A.N,Do you wear it around campus tho ? 
Breakfast Team Captain,May or may not own a make america great again snapback in preparation for being a trump fan club member for halloween
A.L.A.N,"I know Danny's pretty dumb, but cmon, he's not that bad "
A.L.A.N,Nope 
I have a LISP,It wasn't Danny?
A.L.A.N,"There was a student on campus wearing a Trump ""make America great again"" shirt. Wtf"
Breakfast Team Captain,Felt i should change my name since instead of convincing others to drop algorithms i just dropped it myself
GroupMe,#dropalgorithms2k15 changed name to Breakfast Team Captain
GroupMe,#dropalgorithms2k15 added Briana Achtman to the group.
A.L.A.N,But butt computing

#dropalgorithms2k15,Like so into it
#dropalgorithms2k15,WAIT IM SO INTO THIS IDEA
Tuna,"We should get a portable Coleman grill and all cook breakfast in fgh one morning and when other people try to get some be like ""no fuck you"" because we won't share and the atrium will smell like bacon and be awesome. "
A.L.A.N,Make America great again. Like it was in the olden days. Name one thing that happened before the 60s that was bad. 
A.L.A.N,Thst
A.L.A.N,Yes
#dropalgorithms2k15,Make america great again
A.L.A.N,Orrrrr
Mark,Go to bed
mc clanahan,instead of arguing about silly things let's talk about politics
A.L.A.N,Hey I started talking first 
Tuna,"Alan gtfo, those are my eggs"
A.L.A.N,MAKE THEM FOR ++PARTY
Tuna,I will make the toast
A.L.A.N,Yeah what Turner said. 
A.L.A.N,(And then my idiot friend waltzes in and does it right the first time. Grrr. But I'm not bitter) 
Tuna,Poached?
#dropalgorithms2k15,💁🏼
Tuna,"Tiffany, will you make me eggs?"
A.L.A.N,Every time I've tried its ended up looking like puke 
A.L.A.N,No it was I'm surprised you are able to
#dropalgorithms2k15,Yea just get water close to boiling then turn off heat swirl water and gently drop a cracked egg in (helps if you crack in a bowl then ease it in) cover and let sit for 3 mins then take out (ideally w slotted spoon but regular spoon done with finesse also works)
mc clanahan,google it you liberal
A.L.A.N,No but really. You can poach eggs? 
A.L.A.N,Thanks Danny. 
mc clanahan,yeah they're trying to crack down on it but professional poachers still make a living off of it
A.L.A.N,Wait you can poach eggs? 
#dropalgorithms2k15,Wait yay someone sent shoutout to the human race 💗💗
#dropalgorithms2k15,If anyone is in control systems and has the hw questions that are due tomorrow i would love you forever also repay you in cookies or greek yogurt or eggs (prepared any style! Even poached guys) or alcohol i think that covers everything humans like PLEASE help meeee
mc clanahan,sorted lists are communist
Tuna,"sortList = sorted(myList, key=lambda t:int(t[1]))"
Tuna,"If anyone's curious, the answer is this"
Tuna,"I tried 
sortList = map(lambda t:int(t[1]), myList)"
Tuna,"so question, if I had a list of tuples in python, the first containing a string and second containing a int that was read as a string, how could I typecast the int to an int so I can sort numerically?"

Gross,Python library 
Gross,BeautifulSoup 
Tuna,what should I look at if Im interested in writing some code for web scraping?
A.L.A.N,"You missed your namespace declaration, that's gonna generate some serious compile errors"

Tuna,Haha brad. 
GroupMe,"Brad Bark is new to GroupMe and hasn't responded, so we stopped sending them messages from this group."
mc clanahan,conor has anyone ever made a pun on your name sounding like a california condor
Matt Lee,"real talk though, creating a party foul instance with chugtime as a param be better OOP. 
c'mon conor"
GroupMe,Conor Joplin changed name to ⚪️
Conor Joplin,"Party++

 3. party.handle = new Vodka(""skol"");

 5. for (;;) { self.drink(); self.passOut(); continue; }"
GroupMe,Who? changed name to Gross
Who?,I think we should throw one soon
mc clanahan,new PartyBuilder().buildParty().throw()
I have a LISP,I wanna set 'new Party()' up soon
Max Care,It should be party#
mc clanahan,duh
Danny's Arch Nemesis, When is ++Party?
Tuna,can we get drunk
Mitchell,Plz Come
Mitchell,https://www.facebook.com/events/1652919128289286/
GroupMe,Tuna added Brad Bark to the group.
Tuna, Exactly
Max Care,Just a couple of lines. But YMMV seeing as I got 60% on the last one. 
Tuna,How much did yall write for the first 2?
Tuna,Yeah. He said assume undirected in class unless specifically stated otherwise 
hoegrammer,it doesn't specify
hoegrammer,is it ok if it only applies to undirected graphs
mc clanahan,in other news I went outside for the first time today and immediately five bugs landed on my arm
mc clanahan,in order notation
mc clanahan,2m is <= m+n
Max Care,Or actually 2m+n. But same idea. 
Max Care,Yeah I got 2m as well. 
Tuna,I may just be thinking about it wrong
hoegrammer,oh I got 2m which is < (m + n) ..... I think 
Tuna,I think that'd be mn + n
hoegrammer,ok I think I'm just gonna make a new adj list out of it bc I don't know of any list sorting algorithms that are that fast
Max Care,"Sorry, that was late. "
Max Care,I think we have to start with an adjacency list. 
hoegrammer,ohh ok
Tuna,The graph is represented by an adjacency list
hoegrammer,do we have to start with an adjacency list and sort it? or can we create a new adjacency list just from the graph 
mc clanahan,"some problems he may allow you to assume a different structure, but he'll usually say that explicitly"
mc clanahan,"you can always make a different structure, but that does add to the time complexity"
John Lally,Shhhh stop working it's game day 
Tuna,"For 2 in algorithms, do we need to keep it as an adjacency list, or can we put it into a different structure?"
Emma Birdsong,20 minutes into coursera and chill and he gives you this look
mc clanahan,ISIS tech supporters
mc clanahan,tech support itt
Conor Joplin,Thanks!
Conor Joplin,"Ahh cool, that's what I thought"
Conor Joplin,Is that just polymorphism? Or is there a different name for it
Garrett Hoffman,Polymorphism right?

Conor Joplin,@A.L.A.N So close
hoegrammer,wait so what's the vandyhacks thing this week like
mc clanahan,there's a lot more people this year so it should be easier
mc clanahan,"some people do one way, some the other. I came with nothing last year and found some cool people from utk and it worked out fine"
Henry Bogartis,How does everyone do finding groups to do the hackathon with or do you find people beforehand?
I have a LISP,Hey you should all fill out this form for mock interviews with VandyApps! http://goo.gl/forms/0t31dXgDit
GroupMe,Ellis Brown added Jackson Doherty to the group.
Max Care,Got plans with your wife or something?
Mark,Hm that won't work. Can we have it end around 7:15?
I have a LISP,@Ellis Brown Probably by 8 or 8:15. No worries if you have to dip out early

I have a LISP,The meeting starts at 7 but the programming sessions won't start until around 7:15 or 7:20. 
Mark,Aaron that's not gonna work for me. Can we push it back to 7:15?

Luke Kornet,Coursers and chill?
GroupMe,hoegrammer added Paul Gelston Murray to the group.
Tuna,It was a joke Mitchell. Gosh!
mc clanahan,mr robot is great
Mitchell,Turner you're not a hacker
Mark,@Tuna did u hack something 
Max Care,"The query I inherited was nested sixteen layers deep, and cutting it down to eight layers took two weeks of time and like five years off my life. "
Tuna,consider it hacked
mc clanahan,you work on alpha chi? how is their mainframe
Max Care,Yeah working on AX over the summer gave me SQL-PTSD
Bradley Faskowitz,^obviously hasn't written a triple nested query yet
Ellis Brown,SQL so easy
#dropalgorithms2k15,Me me me
Emma Birdsong,Graham Hemingway does
mc clanahan,makes sense
hoegrammer,does anyone want to teach me django and SQL lol
Emma Birdsong,I needed a cover for my brothel

mc clanahan,I'm a liar defs have that set up beforehand
mc clanahan,except wait you said app coding so nvm
mc clanahan,not like a project file or whatever
mc clanahan,usually it's just code
A.L.A.N,What kind of apps? 
hoegrammer,like I got a coding challenge via email but I'm too paranoid to click on it bc it expires after 12 hours
hoegrammer,halp. for job app coding challenges do I need to have all the appropriate IDEs & shit
Emma Birdsong,He drives an Audi R8??
I have a LISP,Too busy driving his R8
Emma Birdsong,Yep
Mitchell,Has anyone noticed Hemmingway stopped updating the reading list for web programming?
A.L.A.N,Also some weeks shouldn't have quizzes so fingers crossed that's this week 
A.L.A.N,That's what I was thinking 
Mark,Idk it'll probably be thursday

hoegrammer,
Emma Birdsong,Thanks friends 😍
mc clanahan,thanks for checking sam
mc clanahan,confirmed that pre registration was the cause
Paparazzi Pepe,all vandy kids get in. I'll double check no one else got that by mistake
Mark,I thought candy kids automatically got in
Paparazzi Pepe,"I think what happened was you pre-registered and I accidentally sent the rejection email to everyone that didn't get selected, including pre-registers"
Paparazzi Pepe,Sorry :(
Emma Birdsong,Literally did not ask
A.L.A.N,He's called Captain Slow! 
A.L.A.N,All we know is

A.L.A.N,He's called the stig 
A.L.A.N,That hes mad entirely out of squirrels. All we know is 
A.L.A.N,Some say he eats nothing but Satco and 
Max Care,Now this just sounds like an introduction for the stig.
Tuna,Does he eat at satco everyday?
Who?,With stacks of coins on each of them?
I have a LISP,Does he still have bottle caps stacked everywhere?
Danny's Arch Nemesis,I'm sure he's used to it by now. His office is 30% paper and he walks around barefoot do the math.
mc clanahan,accidentally gave spinrad a papercut in graph algs today when he handed me a paper so sorry if he's cranky in your class
A.L.A.N,High. If you work hard. Its pretty easy 
John Lally,What is the probability I will get this done by 1 
A.L.A.N,Its a plus the second one is revered and minus I think 
A.L.A.N,+ 
John Lally,The first one has f(n) + g(n) =? O(f'(n) +/- g'(n)) help I can't tell plus or minus can you tell I forgot to do this until right now 
mc clanahan,oh k sorry
A.L.A.N,No that's the first one I think 
mc clanahan,that's wrong
mc clanahan,I thought it was f (n) - g (n) =? O (f'(n) - g'(n))
mc clanahan,no
A.L.A.N,If I remember right that's correct 
hoegrammer,"I think, that's off of memory someone else confirm pls"
hoegrammer,g(n) - f'(n) = O(g'(n) - f(n))
mc clanahan,go hard
John Lally,Hi what is the third question on the Algs hw I can't read the end and didn't write it down like a dumbass 
A.L.A.N,I feel so productive 
A.L.A.N,Is a solid class 
A.L.A.N,That
Tuna,Cloud programming 
mc clanahan,no why are you using it
Max Care,Have any of you had to use Vanderbilt's VPN before?
Danny's Arch Nemesis,Every time I think Danny isn't in featheringill he actually is
mc clanahan,glad he's making good use of his time here

#dropalgorithms2k15,I applied but also dont know what dates it is...care to inform?
Paparazzi Pepe,"But all Vandy students are guaranteed a spot, so don't worry about it"
Paparazzi Pepe,"Eh I've still gotta set that up. Don't worry about it, if you don't sign up before, we'll just have a laptop for you to do it when you show up"
Danny's Arch Nemesis,I mean you just gotta know a brother
mc clanahan,just come lol
Mitchell,@Paparazzi Pepe 
Mitchell,Were gonna have a url just for vandy students
hoegrammer,take my spot
Phillip Hawkins,"@vandyhacks people, the application is closed what imma sposed to do?"
I have a LISP,During the meeting 
I have a LISP,They start next Tuesday
Max Care,"Hey @I have a LISP , when were you going to teach those vandy apps functional programming classes?"
mc clanahan,beep boop
mc clanahan,I do not forget
hoegrammer,we mean 100
hoegrammer,we forgot danny's basically a computer
mc clanahan,yeah mitchell can you tone it down we're not all as fucking talented as you
Max Care,Yeah I can only count to 3
mc clanahan,what the fuck are 4s
Danny's Arch Nemesis,It's way easier if you make sure they're all 3's
Mitchell,That's how I did it ;D
Mitchell,"Alternatively, you can get your transcript and make sure all the CS classes have 4's next to them"
Tuna,sick thanks
Emma Birdsong,Degree audit 
mc clanahan,I actually don't know sorry
Tuna,no. I want an easier way
mc clanahan,you can use math I think
Tuna,how can i find my gpa within major?
GroupMe,Ethan Raymond added Henry Bogartis to the group.
Mitchell,Shit I hope so
Jon Lee,I tink
Jon Lee,End
mc clanahan,is the pl quiz gonna be at the beginning or end of the class
GroupMe,John Lally added Lizzy Diehl to the group.
Max Care,Well that's the issue. 
Mitchell,😉
mc clanahan,it's grammatically correct if you're not a fuck
Mitchell,"He can ""get you in then"""

Conor Joplin,Could someone with card access to FGH 226 open it for me? My office hours are at 1:00 but I left my card in Towers
Ellis Brown,Which sections in ch 5 are covered
Emma Birdsong,"My personal fave was re:Fortran
""It is the language of the streets in the best sense of the word, not in the prostitutional sense of the word."""
Bradley Faskowitz,"Programming languages book: ""Well-known author Daniel McCraken"".  This has to be the most badass name I've ever heard."
mc clanahan,hw is easy as fuck
Bradley Faskowitz,Boooooooo Roth 
Emma Birdsong,Because we didn't cover them
Emma Birdsong,I think the quiz is over some stuff from 3 and 5 too? Anything on the reading list I believe is fair game except the last few sections of chapter 5
Bradley Faskowitz,"So a couple of questions: programming languages quiz is on chapters 1 and 2, correct?  I just realized there is a programming languages hw due tomorrow.  Is it difficult? (Haven't looked at it yet)"
hoegrammer,^would agree
Danny's Arch Nemesis,A&s has way better lecturers in my opinion
mc clanahan,this comes from Julie Adams so probs real
mc clanahan,engineering is apparently harder to get into than arts
hoegrammer,*hairflip*
hoegrammer,admit rate for A&S is p low
mc clanahan,cause I'm here
Matt Lee,why is vandy ranked so highly anyway? are we just being carried by peabody
Mitchell,We actually use their assignment shells and everything
Mitchell,Our AI class is a copy of Berkeleys. I discussed it with a friend who goes there
I have a LISP,Although berkeleys advanced cs intro course uses SICP so they got us there
I have a LISP,"To be fair, my intern friend this summer is at Wisconsin and we were comparing curriculums and were both shocked at how similar they were. He was jealous though that we didn't have 300 people in all our classes, and I was jealous he got to take his DB class with some crazy hot shot researcher (can't remember who)."
mc clanahan,yes quiz
Danny's Arch Nemesis,Who cares about job placement if our curriculum is still shit
Tuna,/is that confidential?
Tuna,Does 251 have a quiz on Thursday?
Ellis Brown,^thats also graduate level... I feel like our guys have been getting job placement indicative of a better undergrad cs department than #56...
I have a LISP,Yay
I have a LISP,Hell yeah we tied two of the worst UC schools
Max Care,"In all seriousness though, 15 overall is pretty cool. "
Max Care,For com sci:
Matt Lee,now only for engineering to catch up to that
Ellis Brown,Swag 
Max Care,"Oh, lots. "
mc clanahan,has he talked about nashville government officials yet
mc clanahan,algorithms is great
Bradley Faskowitz,^^but like your honor though
GroupMe,Douglas Craig Schmidt changed name to Broth
hoegrammer,yo halp me + @Douglas Craig Schmidt w/ algorithms plz
mc clanahan,I can answer qs though
mc clanahan,fuck off brad
mc clanahan,give out quizzes. there's no key
Bradley Faskowitz,Do 251 TAs have their own groupme?  I don't want yo ping.
Tuna,Danny. Do I give out quizzes yet? Where's the key?
Max Care,"Yeah, I've been keeping it up to date"
Conor Joplin,Danny's question counter is off the charts

Bradley Faskowitz,Vanderbiltrejects.com
Mark,What's that site with a bunch of security challenges
Paparazzi Pepe,I am now on a mission to call him Otter whenever I see him.
Mark,But I'll try on the secure version too
Mark,Please don't. It was a good learning experience 
Garrett Hoffman,I've got $3 for whoever hacks Mitchell's secure website 
Mitchell,just to prove a point
Mitchell,but now I will
Mitchell,And I just didn't feel like it
Mitchell,"2. You can't just ""not leave the authentication in the source"". To fix it, I'd have to write a webhook for parse that validates save commands before saving them."
Mark,I don't know how to do it either 
Mitchell,1. I knew the site was vulnerable from the beginning. It's extremely obvious that you can just save whatever values you want from the console. I just didn't care.
Mark,Ok fine
Mitchell,"No Mark, you misunderstand"
#dropalgorithms2k15,"""I was out until 3am on Saturday night. Enjoy your twenties, I'm still paying for it"" -Julie Adams"
mc clanahan,and yeah mark but it's basically like to solve that you would have to do a lot more annoying stuff
mc clanahan,yo jeff I'm in fgh rn the vandyhacks posters look dope
Mark,Mitch your method isn't valid because we were able to screw with your site
GroupMe,Ellis Brown added Sam Carlson to the group.
mc clanahan,yeah jeff we'll have to think of a better one
mc clanahan,sorry I haven't done auth in a while with browser clients
Danny's Arch Nemesis,"Get mitched, McClanahan isn't as fun to say"
Mitchell,goodnight
Mitchell,thank you
mc clanahan,yeah that's actually right oops
Mitchell,MY METHOD IS VALID
Mitchell,I REFUSE TO BE SHAMED FOR THIS
Mitchell,"AND THEN IF YOU NEED TO DO ADDITIONAL VALIDATION, YOU WRITE A WEBHOOK ON THE PARSE SERVER SIDE"
Mitchell,YOU GIVE SPECIFIC PERMISSIONS TO EACH API CLIENT KEY
Mitchell,NO YOU'RE WRONG YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN API KEY TO ACCESS THE API
Mitchell,I'M LAZY THATS WHY I USE PARSE
mc clanahan,the js key is or should be strictly for testing
mc clanahan,that's why you do all api work on the server side lol
Mitchell,going to sleep
Mitchell,ok I'm tired enough that I'm getting into internet arguments
Mitchell,dumbass
Mitchell,So they can still do whatever they want
Mitchell,"even if you pass a hash to the server to get the token, the user still has access to the hash"
Mitchell,did you read the article?
Mitchell,"no danny, you're wrong about the hashes"
mc clanahan,no if you want to ensure security don't contract out
mc clanahan,about what your ddosable face or my immense js knowledge
A.L.A.N,Guyz we're leet haxors
Mitchell,About the hashes and shit
Mitchell,"Danny you are kidding, right?"
mc clanahan,you were asking for it
mc clanahan,you're so ddosable dude
Mitchell,Gratz
Mitchell,You got to 22 requests per second
mc clanahan,mcclanamanhandled
Mitchell,Parse just sent me an email
Mitchell,Also will you fuckers stop trying to DDOS me
Danny's Arch Nemesis,"GET MCCLANAHANNED, MITCH"
mc clanahan,use the token
mc clanahan,send the hash to your server to get the token
mc clanahan,no mitch actually you're wrong you gotta use salted hashes
Mitchell,https://parse.com/questions/javascript-sdk-security
Mitchell,just read this.
Mitchell,^ that's inherently wrong but I don't have the energy to explain it
Mark,Don't leave your authentication in the page source brah
Mitchell,I try to trust the internet for once and this is what I get
Mitchell,Ok Net Sec just cause it's vulnerable doesn't mean you have to hack it
Tuna,i brokeded your website
Tuna,http://www.mcclanahanquestioncounter.xyz lol
Emma Birdsong,It's a two part proof. You have to prove that it's greater than or equal to its lower bound then show a case where it's takes as long as its upper bound. Something like that I think?
Mitchell,Start small. Prove little theta
Tuna,How do you prove big theta?
A.L.A.N,Good. Glad you're not constipated

I have a LISP,Because we're going to bars
A.L.A.N,Why not? 
I have a LISP,Nah don't come
I have a LISP,It's not gonna last long though
A.L.A.N,There's never enough alcohol anywhere
hoegrammer,^thats the real question innit
I have a LISP,We've got a little more alc
Emma Birdsong,Is there enough alcohol there or nah?
Max Care,Asking the real questions. 
I have a LISP,And Adam knows you guys anyways
Sam Zeppos,ha and they say engineers have no social skills
I have a LISP,Definitely
I have a LISP,Yes it's big enough
A.L.A.N,Max's question is on point 
hoegrammer,also
hoegrammer,but is the club is full of ballas and they pockets full grown?
Max Care,Are there enough people that I can show up without knowing Adam that well?
A.L.A.N,Yes. Jumping. 
Emma Birdsong,"""Jumping"" lol"
A.L.A.N,Is the party jumping
I have a LISP,To kissam
I have a LISP,Text Aaron if you need to get in 7606134364
Garrett Hoffman,Come by Adams birthday party!! Warren 236 in Kissam 
Conor Joplin,😢
mc clanahan,it's ok alan we get it
A.L.A.N,I didn't want a solution I wanted to know what the assignment was lol 
mc clanahan,some people aren't fuckin code geniuses like you conor have a little patience
Conor Joplin,"The code from last semester is still in Gitlab. IIRC the first two assignments were pretty simple, so you shouldn't need a solution to help people"
A.L.A.N,I figured that I was wondering about like the assignment just in general 
Mitchell,*never have had solutions*
A.L.A.N,Oh shit right. Thanks Danny.
mc clanahan,the code for assignment one is on bitbucket. we don't have solutions if that's what you're asking
Garrett Hoffman,Pretty sure he didn't assign them the assignment yet anyway. 
A.L.A.N,"Hey 251 TAs, do any of you have like the assignments n such? Cuz I have office hours today and I will have like no idea how to help anyone "
mc clanahan,so my robotics class also has projects due friday at midnight and I'm feeling the burn now
Ellis Brown,^miseravle
Mitchell,This programming languages homework is making me actually want to die
I have a LISP,
Tuna,Blackout?
Max Care,A frozen cesspit. 
Gas Pedal,If he talked about quantum entanglement all the time he deserves to be there
Gas Pedal,That place is a cesspit
mc clanahan,he goes to cornell now thank god
mc clanahan,there was this one kid in my high school who talked about quantum entanglement constantly
A.L.A.N,That's not nice 
Mark,Hey fuck you
A.L.A.N,Marks new name is Carly 
Mark,Should I walk in and say you havent?
Gas Pedal,"Abhishek: ""Surely you've heard of quantum entanglement"" ...???"
Max Care,"I'd like to suggest that everyone in cloud computing install this chrome plugin:

mc clanahan,nice
Tuna,that was it! Im a genius
mc clanahan,"don't think they have one, I'd just remove the goog"
Tuna,what's vandy's dns server ip?
mc clanahan,that could be it
Tuna,*?
Tuna,dafuq. Im getting a DNS probe error? Do you think it's because Im using google dns servers>
Max Care,Yeah
Tuna,did you just type the url into chrome?
A.L.A.N,Ask him in class 
Max Care,Worked for me
Tuna,I used the url and got a webpage error
A.L.A.N,Haven't tried
Tuna,"Hey, can any of yall in cloud computing get onto the isis cloud? It won't work for me"
mc clanahan,unf
hoegrammer,@#dropalgorithms2k15 plz come I'm surrounded by Econ majors in suits
mc clanahan,FUCKING CALLED IT
mc clanahan,"""danny, would you mind grading this week's quiz?"""
mc clanahan,you should apply this to other areas of your life
#dropalgorithms2k15,W/e i dropped that class before  it even had the chance to drop me
hoegrammer,I don't think I know anyone else with strong opinions about KC & The Sunshine Band
Danny's Arch Nemesis,They're the best part of his class.
Tuna,It makes it less dry
Tuna,I kind of like spinrads  stories. 
Max Care,I'm glad we're able to learn all of these Elvis facts from algorithms. 
Gas Pedal,@hoegrammer you rock
hoegrammer,"was gonna tell @Gas Pedal  that I am good for 10/3, only in atlanta that sunday"
Tuna,I see you yoko
mc clanahan,literally told you
Tuna,Yeah. Come back @#dropalgorithms2k15 
Mark,@#dropalgorithms2k15 he increased the size of the class 
Emma Birdsong,Vital information http://newsroom.uber.com/nashville/2015/09/were-delivering-free-mac-on-demand/
#dropalgorithms2k15,^me probz
hoegrammer,BlackRock info session tomorrow 7PM in Wilson 126 who wants 2 go
Tuna,So much!!!!
A.L.A.N,What'd I miss? I had a meeting for work 
Tuna,I loved it. 
Gas Pedal,So many bro(grammer)s
Bradley Faskowitz,Vandyapps meeting at 8 felt like a frat.
Who?,Wow u got me 
Ellis Brown,Adam is stealing the 8pm pizza watch out https://v.groupme.com/13238999/2015-09-02T00:22:08Z/1f40106d.568x320r90.mp4
Tuna,the cool nerds are going to the 8pm Vandyapps meeting FYI
A.L.A.N,True enough. 
Tuna,I mean. I'm on payroll
A.L.A.N,Show 
A.L.A.N,I mean if otte hasn't annoucned when people are having them n o one will 
Tuna,Can I go ahead and hold office hours Danny?
Gas Pedal,I'll email you!
hoegrammer,do we have arduinos sitting around? or are we just using one
hoegrammer,it should! very slim chance I'll be going to Atlanta but I'll let you know in advance 4 sure
Gas Pedal,@hoegrammer fabulous!! Does that date work for you?
hoegrammer,I taught girls how to use arduinos this summer they're so fun
hoegrammer,@Gas Pedal YES
Tuna,"Not enough ""fuck""s"
Bradley Faskowitz,"""What do you mean you don't know what a semaphore is!?"" - enraged Danny at middle schoolers"
Tuna,You should get Danny. That way he can swear at them and scare them with his pink hair. 
Gas Pedal,Boys can help too but girls are especially awesome :)
Mark,Why are you trying to take the ladies away from vandyhacks
Gas Pedal,Ladies: Would any of you be free on October 3rd from 9:00-4:00 to help with an engineering day for middle school aged girls here at Vandy?  I have designed and will be running a computer/electrical engineering module that involves building a circuit and programming an Arduino and need a co-leader for the session.  Let me know if you think you might could help!
A.L.A.N,I'll look after lunch 
A.L.A.N,Really? Last summer they sent me an email saying I couldn't forward it anymore and then disabled it. Like I tried to change it back and it didn't work 
mc clanahan,not for me?
A.L.A.N,They turned that off 
A.L.A.N,I can't 
mc clanahan,just forward it
A.L.A.N,Some student employees (me past 2 years) can't 
A.L.A.N,Like the vandy gmail 
mc clanahan,yes? 
A.L.A.N,Do TAs get to use gmail or nah? 
Tuna,http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dROF7dub0As/T1drSLkZILI/AAAAAAAABkc/BzkPssjnLA0/s640/Neil-deGrasse-Tyson-we-got-a-badass-over-here-gif.gif
mc clanahan,no it's not I had 10
A.L.A.N,That's a lot 
mc clanahan,but like since we have more now that's less important
mc clanahan,like 6 minimum I think
Garrett Hoffman,How many hours a week did you guys usually work last year? 
A.L.A.N,Idk when my office hours are though... 
Tuna,I just want to start so I can get paid. 
mc clanahan,I would recommend being at office hours though
mc clanahan,dude dw nothing happened
A.L.A.N,Like confirmed we didn't meet yesterday 
A.L.A.N,251 
mc clanahan,oh lol dw
mc clanahan,about what
Tuna,No. I wonder if I should start hours today?
A.L.A.N,Has anyone heard from otte?

Max Care,"Oh, kk. Thanks!"
mc clanahan,he had hs robotics friends there which helped
mc clanahan,I'll text him
mc clanahan,he just applied I thought
Max Care,Do you guys know who Win talked to at Tesla?
GroupMe,"Std::cout added Jon Lee, Doug Lisk, and Taylor Beck to the group."
mc clanahan,he did that in the first day of class already literally I can't
mc clanahan,watch him respond at 11pm and give some bullshit excuse about his wife
mc clanahan,I just emailed him
William Otte,If you haven't heard by late tonight that's fair
Tuna,"Ok, well I'm sleeping in in that case."
William Otte,So give me about 2 days 
William Otte,I mean I have like at least 12 more hours to make that call 
William Otte,Nope 
Tuna,"Yo. 251 ta's, Have yall heard from otte about our meeting yet?"
hoegrammer,thank you @Gas Pedal !!
Gas Pedal,@hoegrammer ask Justin Paul -- justin.s.paul@vanderbilt.edu
Emma Birdsong,He did 
hoegrammer,@Emma Birdsong did he sing trumpets omg
hoegrammer, me? PM or software internship
Ellis Brown,^what are you applying for
mc clanahan,rt a thousand times
Emma Birdsong,I only swoon over impressive algorithms so like what're you gonna do?
John Lally,Maybe he'll sing you another song? He seemed a little confused that you didn't swoon when he serenaded you. 
Emma Birdsong,😎
hoegrammer,I mean I'm not into it but idk if you are?
Emma Birdsong,He sent me a friend request this morning do I accept?
hoegrammer,ps @Emma Birdsong boy u were flirting w/ yesterday was sad u left

mc clanahan,mad props to @Mitchell  for answering piazza qs at 11pm on a friday night
mc clanahan,jeff is my arch nemesis
Ellis Brown,I still have no clue who is actually Danny. Haha
mc clanahan,cause one of them matters and the other is a small subset of cs 250
Danny's Arch Nemesis,Why would you take graph algorithms when you can take graph theory
William Otte,I have diff eq or I so would
mc clanahan,it's 5 grad students and me
mc clanahan,mwf
William Otte,On? 
mc clanahan,10
William Otte,When is it? 
mc clanahan,graph algorithms with my boy spinrad
William Otte,What's 6311? 
William Otte,I just forgot how to English 
William Otte,By error codes I meant error correcting codes/cryptography
mc clanahan,take 6311
mc clanahan,tf is error codes
William Otte,And I was considering that or error codes. But error codes is very morning. 
William Otte,I need another class 
mc clanahan,it's good for nerds like conor with nothing better to do with their lives
Max Care,I'm dropping it after going to the first class
Conor Joplin,Like threading and semenphores
Conor Joplin,It's android stuff/some OS concepts 
William Otte,Seriously? 
mc clanahan,no
William Otte,Is os 2 useful? 
GroupMe,Ellis Brown added Luke Kornet to the group.

Conor Joplin,"Don't make me pull your ponytail, little girl"
mc clanahan,@Conor Joplin  I'll break your legs
Matt Lee,"last semester people had to stand if they didnt get to class early enough, but spinrad let everyone in anyway"
Mark,Max was crying
Tuna,Werd. Max was suffrin 
Max Care,Bruh get out. I had to sit on the floor yesterday. 
Mark,Tiffany pls
Tuna,Wtf. You were in there yesterday!
GroupMe,Terrified of groupme pic changed name to #dropalgorithms2k15
Terrified of groupme pic,But for real guy plz drop algorithms im getting a lil desperate
mc clanahan,get fucked
Gas Pedal,I was in a senior design meeting so ya'll can all leave
Bradley Faskowitz,Rebecca was late 
William Otte,Cuz she failed the first time 
Tuna,Why are you taking it again?
Gas Pedal,'ppreciate ya
William Otte,Fgh 132
Phillip Hawkins,there's one right now in fgh 132
Gas Pedal,The first one -- 281
William Otte,Which one ? 
Gas Pedal,Where is operating systems?
GroupMe,Matt Lee added Jason Xiong to the group.
mc clanahan,sucks to your ass-mar
William Otte,My mom can't read
mc clanahan,ask your mom
William Otte,Read it to us Emma 
Emma Birdsong,
Tuna,Oh my god! Who cares?!
hoegrammer,there are like at least 10
hoegrammer,actually I am pleasantly surprised by the number of girls in here
hoegrammer,I think... there are not enough dudes in algorithms
Tuna,Just walked into theater history and the prof started playing run dmc music video. What is liberal arts
Tuna,I made it on the waitlist at least.
mc clanahan,I'm so jeal of everyone in web programming
hoegrammer,^ @Terrified of groupme pic you have hope!!!
Emma Birdsong,I would go anyway. Last year spinrad told the class on the first day that he was letting everyone off the wait list so like  miracles happen
Ellis Brown,It's still closed but I might just go to the class anyway today and see what's straight
Ellis Brown,Anyone know if web programming is gonna open any slots
mc clanahan,I tried to boot linux on my surface and it just yelled at me
Gas Pedal,it basically accosted my touchpad and it's just now recovering
mc clanahan,I've never really dealt with windows 10 as much as it just allowed me to believe I have some control over it
Gas Pedal,dealing w windows 10
mc clanahan,I'm programming what's your excuse
Gas Pedal,"Danny, I sense that this is just one of many days this year that we will find each other up at 2 in the morning"
mc clanahan,I'm CRYING
Gas Pedal,@William Otte @Mark in May if everything goes as planned
William Otte,Mark making the saves 
Mark,2hen are you graduating @Gas Pedal 
mc clanahan,tinder for uber drivers
Tuna,I'm not ahead with # of credits. Just cs classes. 
mc clanahan,fuk vandy I'm making a startup
William Otte,When????????
Gas Pedal,@William Otte yes really
William Otte,I'm with Mark. #vandyftw
Mark,But vandy is so fun
mc clanahan,@Mitchell is leaving next sem too
mc clanahan,most people do
William Otte,The really was to Rebecca 
mc clanahan,"cs has zero required courses you can join a frat, do masters, leave early, double major, whatever"
William Otte,Really? 
Mark,"I could too but am doing the masters. Not sure how I got so far ahead though, it's weird"
Gas Pedal,@Matt Lee I'm graduating early
Matt Lee,"7 APs though, but hopefully im not doing something gravely wrong lol"
Matt Lee,also are you guys fairly ahead in terms of CS scheduling? ive taken only 4 classes the past semester or two (granted theyre all core reqs) but im still pretty far ahead for graduating
William Otte,Oh yeah right they fucked jt all up 
Tuna,http://media1.giphy.com/media/RPVI1UkZwOkZq/giphy.gif
Conor Joplin,It's now Math 2810 for anyone looking
William Otte,216 I mean 
William Otte,Math 226 
William Otte,216 
Tuna,Can I be you?
Conor Joplin,What's the engineering statistics class?
Tuna,Hi Tiffany! I've been enjoying your shambly snapchats this summer!
William Otte,And still counts 
William Otte,Its way easier 
William Otte,Lol oh yeah 
Matt Lee,math statsss although can we take engineering stats for cs major? that sounds easier lol
GroupMe,Chris Lee changed name to Std::cout
William Otte,I retract my previous statement
William Otte,Oh valid 
Emma Birdsong,^didn't know which one he meant
William Otte,Wow so useful
Emma Birdsong,I think it's different than the engineering stats book
Emma Birdsong,I have math stats?
Matt Lee,hey anyone have a stats book? got tired of asking non engineering majors
Danny's Arch Nemesis,http://www.theverge.com/2015/8/24/9196553/wiz-khalifa-hoverboard-handcuffed
Tuna,Is that a Segway?
mc clanahan,what the fuck is that
Conor Joplin,So it begins
GroupMe,Terrified of groupme pic added Chris Lee to the group.
Emma Birdsong,Okay I was curious! Thank you! 😊
I have a LISP,If you have any ideas about how we can do a better job of helping them or just want to talk vandyapps in general you can pm me!
I have a LISP,"We have not, primarily because we have non profits reach out to us fairly regularly and we already aren't able to help all of them (or even a some of them). Unfortunately right now we just don't have the capacity to actually build things that need finishing for people (if you know what I mean). We're actively working on the problem and are trying a few possible solutions this year."
Emma Birdsong,@VandyApps have you guys ever thought about reaching out to local non-profits to offer your services?
hoegrammer,I walked in and left
Tuna,fuggin sick
Emma Birdsong,Noooo I went to bed at like 11 haha. I'm glad I didn't go because that sounds like my nightmare
hoegrammer,it was more crowded than beta
hoegrammer,@Emma Birdsong were you at the party in will's suite yesterday? what the hell
Emma Birdsong,Teleport 
William Otte,How do we get to class then? 
Emma Birdsong,Everyone knows CS majors don't go outside duh
William Otte,"""The otte/Schmidt fan club"" "
William Otte,Thought: we should go to founders walk and stand there and pretend we're a club 
GroupMe,hoegrammer added Connor Lehr to the group.
mc clanahan,girls don't shit right
Conor Joplin,
Mark,"Microsoft boys, fix cortana. She can't do shit"

I have a LISP,^tru
Ellis Brown,Escalator

Conor Joplin,"Nice! Also the real question on that stairstepper pic:
Why is he wearing flip flops"
hoegrammer,u got it
Conor Joplin,You're with Zoya and Allie and all them?
Conor Joplin,I believe so!
hoegrammer,ps @Conor Joplin according to my roommates I'm apparently in the suite next 2 u
Emma Birdsong,Booty call
I have a LISP,Wtf
mc clanahan,one day I hope to bypass linux altogether and just run emacs directly on the processor
mc clanahan,I use it as a window manager now
mc clanahan,use emacs
Mitchell,EZPZ
Mitchell,just learn windows shortcuts
Gas Pedal,I'll look into the drivers. I managed to make the arrow appear and move but I have no clicking capabilities
Emma Birdsong,"I checked for driver updates in the settings and it told me it was up to date, but I had to go online and actually look for driver updates to discover that they had a windows 10 update. "
Mark,Or press that function key that turns your touch pad on/off
Emma Birdsong,When I updated I couldn't scroll and it wound up being a driver issue
Mark,Borrow a mouse and reinstall the driver 
Gas Pedal,Please tell me this is a joke
I have a LISP,It's part of their ongoing effort to better involve age group minorities (primarily those 70+) in the engineering community by forcing them to use keybindings.
I have a LISP,"I believe they added vim key bindings.

""We believe that everyone should learn vim, because programming."" - Bill Gates, 2015"
I have a LISP,I hear they brought back the start menu but dropped mouse support completely so that makes sense
Gas Pedal,I am scooting around angrily using the keyboard
Gas Pedal,I just upgraded to Windows 10 and it made my mouse disappear wtf
mc clanahan,"also the guy next to me on the metro just used the term ""conversely"" unironically in conversation"
mc clanahan,what happened to #equality
Emma Birdsong,Why they gotta be girls though
I have a LISP,I crack myself up sometimes! (Just thought I'd let you all know)
I have a LISP,"For one of the advanced programming sessions I use names of women. Here are the names I came up with: perl girl, susy queue, mary trie, and ann boolean."
Danny's Arch Nemesis,And otte and Schmidt! 
Sam Zeppos,Wait we get paid for being a TA? I thought working with Danny was payment enough
mc clanahan,first one to get it is the head ta
mc clanahan,he nailed the syllabus to one of the oaks surrounding fgh
Gas Pedal,"Abhishek: ""Please take a look at the syllabus uploaded on the oak"""
William Otte,Thanks

I have a LISP,Small programs?
Terrified of groupme pic,Small mind small head?
Emma Birdsong,"You know what they say, small mind, small..."
mc clanahan,us small minded men are having trouble telling the difference
Emma Birdsong,Gonna start using <joke></joke>
Gas Pedal,Emma we are fostering a lot of confusion with our jokes
Emma Birdsong,(Sry I was kidding)
I have a LISP,She's always been super helpful to us
I have a LISP,No not that I know of.....
Emma Birdsong,But fyi Dr Johnson said nothing about VandyApps when I was talking to her so like yall beefin or nah?
Emma Birdsong,Lol bye 🙈
Gas Pedal,I'm kidding -- VandyCS is a sore spot with some of the VandyAppers haha. But thank you for the informative response!
Emma Birdsong,No I don't think so. Though they don't have an anchor link page which makes me concerned about their registration. 
Gas Pedal,Is that the same thing as VandyApps?
Emma Birdsong,"The club, but I found it!"
Mitchell,"Btw, did you mean vandycs the club or the department"
Emma Birdsong,"But she doesn't quite understand touch screens. Idk if you've seen her snapchat video ""just chillin"" but she like aggressively taps the screen to switch cameras"
William Otte,Or at least the concept of email 
William Otte,Hillary sure does 
Emma Birdsong,Bernie strikes me as a guy who still doesn't quite grasp email attachments 
William Otte,Bernie 
Emma Birdsong,Who is the president of VandyCS?

Ellis Brown,"I've been checking periodically too, they should have made more spots 😠"
Tuna,Yeah. I'll do that
Emma Birdsong,"Yeah Hemingway said it was the grad one. Honestly, you could try emailing him. Especially if all the grad student spots aren't full. "
Tuna,"Theres a new one, but it looks like grad"
Tuna,no.
Emma Birdsong,Are you on the wait list?
Tuna,I wanna be in it :(
Tuna,Are any of yall in web programming?
I have a LISP,Turnt up turner Tuesday's 
Emma Birdsong,Pregame VandyApps
I have a LISP,FYI VandyApps meetings are changing to Tuesday's at 7. Drinking can resume on Thursday evenings
hoegrammer,@Terrified of groupme pic tutor me in neurobiology of behavior and you got a deal
Bradley Faskowitz,Yeah I'd really appreciate it if you dropped algorithms so Tiffany can take that class
Mark,Yeah drop it so tiffany can get in
Terrified of groupme pic,^drop algorithms so i can get in plz and thanks
hoegrammer,I'm not taking a programming class this semester fingers crossed I don't forget everything!!!
hoegrammer,oh weird it showed up green when I first searched it but now it's blue
Emma Birdsong,The wait list is full 😢
William Otte,But I might be wrong 
William Otte,Last I checked it was full 
hoegrammer,oh shit. should I take that instead of comp org or algorithms....
Emma Birdsong,Lol jk
I have a LISP,"It's not new, but hemingway'll he way better than the last guy"
Emma Birdsong,"Yeah Prof Hemingway is teaching it, it's new this semester "
hoegrammer,theres a web dev class? I'm missing something here
Emma Birdsong,I am
Mark,Are yall in it 
Mark,Yes
Sam Zeppos,"html, css, jquery, redis, react"
Mitchell,Yo does anyone know what topics are going to be covered in Web Programming
Mark,Tiffany put the stuff on there ya fool
Emma Birdsong,^ they also give great portions for a bougie place
Terrified of groupme pic,Etch is delicious and one time a couple from chicago bought my dinner there 
William Otte,"I read that as kanye prime steaks and I was like ""Kanye owns a steak house? Damn!"" "
Emma Birdsong,Also saw Dean Wisclo at city house once 
Terrified of groupme pic,Kayne prime steaks
Emma Birdsong,RT^
Terrified of groupme pic,City house has like unreal pizza/pasta
Terrified of groupme pic,Also city fire $8 bottomless mimosas at brunch
Terrified of groupme pic,So i cant edit on my phone but theres a really cool speakeasy above the italian place on belcourt i think its called like savarino cucina or something italian like that lol
hoegrammer,also tin cup coffee in downtown shares space with a web dev company so their seating area is like tech incubator-like with giant tables and monitors and shit someone geek out and get coffee w/ me
Emma Birdsong,Love acme! It's cool that you can get the experience you want based on which floor you choose
hoegrammer,acme isn't really a bar but I want to get drunk there every night forever
Emma Birdsong,Love yourself 🙏🏽
hoegrammer,how about tequila cowboy
hoegrammer,tin?
Emma Birdsong,Also I added a bar page! But if someone puts Dan's on there...😒
Emma Birdsong,Yeah it is! And their fries 😍
hoegrammer,they have a japanese fried chicken sandwich!! it is pretty good ngl
mc clanahan,*sniffs* beautiful
Emma Birdsong,I liked that I could get a sushi roll with fried chicken in it. That's my idea of America. 
mc clanahan,god damn it I was literally planning to go there
Emma Birdsong,It was replaced by lucky belly
mc clanahan,is zumi dead
Emma Birdsong,"Yeah they did (RIP zumi), they had various bowls that were hit or miss"
hoegrammer,ya I took rani to sonobana and he asked me where the pad thai was on the menu... apparently zumi serves pad thai.
Emma Birdsong,"I've heard good things! Also, in case anyone had a dangerous curiosity like me, sushi train is disgusting. Zon't zo it. "
hoegrammer,"but @Emma Birdsong  you should check out Sonobana. it's decent quality, in the same complex as target"
hoegrammer,"literally who ate a salmon roll and was like ""i would really like strawberry and kiwi sauces on this"" (lookin at you, lucky belly)"
hoegrammer,fuck your samurai roll
hoegrammer,what is a dragon roll
hoegrammer,but like how am i supposed to take food seriously if it's named after mythical creatures or weird archaic japanese memorabilia
Max Care,"But not really, because nowhere sells good tuna."
Max Care,I make the best sushi in nashville.
Emma Birdsong,Lol well some of us have never been to SF so we have to take what we can get ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
hoegrammer,people like to ask me about sushi places and all the places they mention are overpriced asian-fusion spots where they like drizzle weird sauces over rolls and shit
Max Care,In case you were planning on eating there.
Max Care,"One time I was in PF changs, and a pipe exploded in the ceiling, raining brownish water into the kitchen."
hoegrammer,$10 that beef is maybe a 2 on the Satay scale. maaaybe.
Danny's Arch Nemesis,"But we have pf Chang's with menu items such as ""beef a la sichuan"""
hoegrammer,"I love nashville but their asian food selection is actually abysmal. like, what major city has absolutely zero decent chinese food??"
hoegrammer,"hahaha probably. like, TTJ has three varieties of ramen and two of them just seem really bizarre to me (like paitan broth is supposed to be opaque and creamy? but the chicken paitan just looks like chicken noodle soup?)"
Emma Birdsong,I think how you feel about ramen in Nashville is how I feel about places like Loveless and the Row. It's southern-ish but it's not real southern food 
hoegrammer,"eh I would say the ramen at TTJ is like. pretty ok. then again most of my ramen experience has been in the bay area, and like, Japan."
Emma Birdsong,It's the quality of ingredients. The ramen I had in LA was cheaper but it didn't taste nearly as fresh and the broth was like..questionable. 
hoegrammer,two ten jack and otaku charge literally twice what I expect to pay for ramen
hoegrammer,looooooooool
Emma Birdsong,"Heads up, totally saw Otte at Two Ten Jack once 🙈"
Emma Birdsong,^ loving all of this
Mark,Holy smokes
hoegrammer,hope yall can benefit off of my fiscal irresponsibility & coffee addiction
hoegrammer,added 20 coffee places. I have a problem
Tuna,add whatever!
Tuna,Yes.
hoegrammer,sweg
Max Care,I would use the coffee list. 
Mark,Yah player
hoegrammer,should I add coffee places?
Tuna,"It was originally for personal use and, therefore, not well thought out. But I think as long as it's by rating, it's good."
hoegrammer,"would recommend separating into sheets for casual, formal, coffee, bars, etc. but otherwise it's cool! i'm def using this"
hoegrammer,this is cool!!
Tuna,add them
William Otte,Or commons 
William Otte,Is rand on there 
Tuna,"Even if you haven't visited them, add them!"
Tuna,"Like fureal! Share with friends, etc. Try not to delete it alL!"
Tuna,Hey. a while back I made a spreadsheet of restaurants I wanted to hit up in Nashville. Feel free to reference and add to it (even if it's a local fave). I want to be able to link it to anyone whether a local or out of towner and have them use it! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r48CIV1eGAeen0iao-NPYLnwRVXIJSTUv24IQrgpnCs/edit?usp=sharing

I have a LISP,"Just reserved a room for vandyapps this semester. Was approved, but with this stipulation: ""No candles, glitter, confetti, sand, hay, rice, dance wax or similar materials are permitted in this space."""
hoegrammer,it is 81 in Cupertino and 66 in SF rn
hoegrammer,also SF weather is very different from Bay Area weather FYI because San Francisco is consistently 10-15 degrees cooler tgan the rest of the bay
hoegrammer,just visited @Danny's Arch Nemesis @ fb and debated this for like an hour
Bradley Faskowitz,Seattle is a great place to live.  I've visited many times since we've moved.  It's just the weather is terrible and would not recommend for someone whose mood corresponds to the weather.
Mark,So I'm in CO Springs and it's practically a desert here except this summer where it rains literally every day. So who knows?
Max Care,"Yeah. It was clear skies all the time I was there, but I've heard that its pretty much cloudy 24/7 the rest of the year. "
I have a LISP,I was pointing out that most of vandy has only been there for internships during the.... Summer
mc clanahan,oh yeah I was just saying as a general thing
I have a LISP,Well I think I was agreeing with brad bc he said they moved since it was dreary
mc clanahan,yeah cause fuck brad
I have a LISP,I guess I've heard that it's more the cloudiness than the rain that's annoying
I have a LISP,Dry/not always cloudy
I have a LISP,Has anyone besides brad lived there when it's not summer? My understanding was that summer was the only dry time
Danny's Arch Nemesis,"Well its like a drizzle for a couple hours a day, it doesn't ever pour. Don't even need an umbrella most of the time"
mc clanahan,probably a weird weather thing
mc clanahan,well it's defs cloudy but it rained maybe three times while I was there lol
Bradley Faskowitz,Source:  lived in Seattle for 2 years and we had to move because it was always so dreary 
Bradley Faskowitz,The thing about the rain in Seattle is definitely not true.  It rains longer and harder than Kobe in the 2006 playoffs.
Phillip Hawkins,ya boiii is
Terrified of groupme pic,Not to interrupt this convo but is anyone taking human computer interaction in the fall? Just wondering

mc clanahan,I know twenty new three letter acronyms thanks to microsoft
Sam Zeppos,"No, I'm in the empire business "
mc clanahan,wow sam nice use of three letter codes. do you work in tech or something? 
I have a LISP,Because most likely you're moving like 20 minutes away
I have a LISP,True true. I guess what I was saying is that in the Bay Area if you switch jobs you don't have to move all your crap to another state and most of your friends can remain the same. 
Sam Zeppos,"You can always move after a few years if you don't like it. Early in your career, I feel like the bay area is the way to go. Especially for connections and jobs. And some companies let you transfer offices. Like you can transfer to Seattle after a couple years in MPK."
I have a LISP,"Another benefit of the valley is that when you switch jobs, as you inevitably will, you might not even have to move, especially because almost every tech company has a presence there, big and small."
I have a LISP,Any big companies you go to in Seattle aren't going to have as diverse/interesting of projects to work on.
Sam Zeppos,Tldr: almost all of the cool stuff is in MPK
Danny's Arch Nemesis,"Also Facebook specific things to consider: Facebook Seattle is in the city, and Menlo park is like an hour from SF, so if you want to live in the city, your commute will be much longer in mpk.

Most product's core teams are in mpk. Seattle has a lot of infrastructure, ads, and less product focused teams. 

Dinner is a lot better in mpk, so you're more likely to eat all 3 meals at mpk every day, whereas that's less likely in Seattle."
William Otte,That's what stealing is for. Just steal a car 
Danny's Arch Nemesis,Oh wait you're applying for full time.
Danny's Arch Nemesis,"Also more diverse in general. Like 70% of people you meet here are in tech and it's overwhelming. Also since it's for an internship, Seattle has better public transportation imo which is huge when you don't have a car."
mc clanahan,yeah california condor is right
Conor Joplin,"Seattle is better IMO. Reasons:

 1. Seattle has a more diverse natural environment surrounding it. The mountains and lakes are beautiful, and it would take you quite a drive to find something comparable outside of SF

2. The cost of living is way lower. Both are high, but your dollar will go a lot further in Seattle than SF

3. There are way fewer homeless people peeing on the walls in Seattle. SF just smells like piss man. And shit. Someone shit on the Bart while I was in SF.

4. Seattle is right next to Canada/Vancouver. That's a plus for me.

5. The weather in Seattle is nicer than SF. It only really rains during the winter, and the summers will paradoxically be warmer than SF.

Either place is good, but if you can go to Seattle, definitely do that."
Danny's Arch Nemesis,Seattle all day

Phillip Hawkins,interesting move tho cause the google name is what people recognize
I have a LISP,Should also keep riskier arms from damaging the stock price of Google proper

I have a LISP,I heard a story about a programmer who named everything after different fruits. Company couldn't fire him because the only person who understood anything about his code was him.
mc clanahan,better than michael basset who just names everything with different numbers of underscores
Mitchell,Turn in assignments that way
hoegrammer,"""can someone tell me what the fuck ふ is?"" ""foo"""
mc clanahan,so you're just executing at microsoft level

hoegrammer,^ I should do that to fuck w/ other coders
mc clanahan,I think it has Unicode support for kana variable names etc
mc clanahan,ruby used to be only japanese for a while and it's also nice and useful

Max Care,And are also super interesting. http://krebsonsecurity.com/all-about-skimmers/
Max Care,Nah ATM skimmers can be super well hidden. 
mc clanahan,"they said it was from an rfid scanner, likely placed on an atm. I thought something like that would be visually obvious but I guess I was wrong. that or I was drunk"
mc clanahan,they blocked every fake transaction and said if I see any more false results I can contact their fraud team for which I was given a 24/7 phone number so yes

Max Care,"Yeah not gonna lie, when I got into vandy I had to look up where it was. "
mc clanahan,"america is a trashy country, so it makes sense brad would call it his home"
Bradley Faskowitz,"Vanderbilt is a bad school, so it makes sense that Danny would go there."
mc clanahan,lol I'd never heard of vandy before the day I applied so I'm not too shocked but yeah nobody's heard of it outside of the south
hoegrammer,also people keep asking me about Texas
hoegrammer,people in CA like to pretend the south doesn't exist I think

William Otte,I mean my experience with southern donuts has been krispy kreme. And their donuts are like sticky water 
hoegrammer,if your bagels aren't artisanal what's even the point
Emma Birdsong,Maybe it's because I'm southern and we practically come with diabetes already installed
hoegrammer,I prefer bagels.........
Emma Birdsong,Like a bagel is a disappointing donut. If you're hungry it'll do the job but it's not as good
William Otte,What 
Emma Birdsong,I feel like if windows 8.1 were a donut windows 10 is a bagel
Mark,Whatever that means! He gets to travel a lot though

hoegrammer,SO about vandy hacks: missed the first one because Die Antwoord ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ but Friday of this year's also coincides with Death Grips SO why is this year's 3 days instead of 2? is it bad if I miss a few hours in the evening of the first day?

I have a LISP,So did you say this is built into coffee script?
mc clanahan,yeah that's why I want continuations to turn async code sync
I have a LISP,Haha
mc clanahan,oh lol yeah
mc clanahan,literally it's five lines of code and they just memcpy the stack it's hilarious
I have a LISP,So the async call in order to make the constructor was hidden
mc clanahan,yeah dude I wanted to see hiw they were implemented so I looked up the guile scheme interpreter
I have a LISP,I was more trying to think of a way to encapsulate the factory inside a monad
mc clanahan,I mean the monad would be used in the factory function if I get what you're saying
I have a LISP,Hmm that's interesting. I'll have to read up on continuations some more
I have a LISP,Nm I was ignoring the constructor issue again
mc clanahan,*of
I have a LISP,"I don't know enough about monads to know for sure, but I imagine the ""return"" call would construct the object using an async call, not sure what bind would do... Maybe the same as a promise?"
mc clanahan,"yeah, promises make playing with a bunch if different async shit super easy so yes"
I have a LISP,Interesting. Would it be possible to make a builder monad that did that same thing?
I have a LISP,Okay yeah you just said what I was gonna say do I stopped haha
I have a LISP,Right so you basically end up with static methods that Bulls
mc clanahan,etc etc
mc clanahan,so you have to make a factory
mc clanahan,"yes, especially since some functions like constructors (!!) literally cannot have any async code at all"
I have a LISP,Creating object from async op
I have a LISP,Err how fundamental that series of operations is
I have a LISP,So it's obviously possible to do with callbacks (or syntactic sugar over callbacks a la monads) but it's inelegant given how fundamental it is?
I have a LISP,Ohhh interesting
mc clanahan,and there are other cool things you can do too but that's the most exciting
GroupMe,I have a LISP changed the group's name to Monads and gonads
mc clanahan,"if this was plain js, you'd be stuck with large callback chains in the code that called the constructor. with continuations, you can literally just turn that synchronous"
mc clanahan,"however, constructors fire synchronously"
mc clanahan,"you wish to construct an object, but it requires data that has only an async api"
mc clanahan,"your code is javascript, so it has some async bits"
mc clanahan,ok so imagine your code
mc clanahan,"I agree with the position, but when I say runtime support I mean it's a pretty fundamental feature that's not possible to do in plain js"
I have a LISP,What are the advantages to having runtime support over just using monads?
I have a LISP,Hmm. I feel like I would prefer a smaller language core a la lisp or JavaScript and then using monads to add that support 
mc clanahan,I'm halfway to hacking it into v8 rn actually
mc clanahan,eich brought it up as a possibility for es8 but it's unlikely
I have a LISP,"Like they aren't monads, but rather something built in?"
mc clanahan,"no, continuations require runtime support"
I have a LISP,"I haven't used coffee script enough to know, but are continuations a part of the language? "
mc clanahan,2) what they're trying to emulate is continuations which are actually fucking useful
mc clanahan,1) if you used coffeescript you wouldn't have this problem
mc clanahan,"promises are fucking stupid, they're syntactic sugar because people don't like the way callback chains look"
I have a LISP,Like for instance I found out recently that JavaScript promises are just monads. And then it all made more sense...
I have a LISP,"Yeah I just want it to basically be an exposure kind of thing. Not making anyone pros in anything (or just learning Haskell to learn Haskell), but learning some concepts that are applicable everywhere"
I have a LISP,Ugh coffee script is gross
mc clanahan,no those seem cool cause then people like me will actually look at the haskell docs without screaming
mc clanahan,except I tried using vanilla js recently and I hated it coffeescript is so much nicer lol
I have a LISP,But I'm open to ideas if you have some!!!
I have a LISP,"Basically I'd like to cover currying, first class functions, map reduce filter, then monads and transforming monads, then some type theory stuff"
mc clanahan,rad
I have a LISP,And then transition into Haskell after a few weeks and important topics have been covered
I have a LISP,Yeah I might just do straight up JavaScript
mc clanahan,you gotta free your mind
mc clanahan,why the fuck was there only types on there you motherfucker
mc clanahan,I love lisp
hoegrammer,yeah and I know a lot of people whose health insurance only covers medical care within CA unless it's an emergency so they use student health insurance
Max Care,"Hey, it exists for a reason. Because its charged by default it's covered by financial aid, and is the only health insurance I have. "
hoegrammer,also you can see prior submitted forms so if you've waived before and are still on the same insurance you can just copy paste everything 
hoegrammer,it's the first link
hoegrammer,just google Gallagher Koster Vanderbilt
I have a LISP,Bleh fvandy
Bradley Faskowitz,The deadline is actually August 1st but get on it.  It may be $1500 you don't have to pay.
William Otte,Yeah can you drop it here? 
I have a LISP,Can you send it to me brad?
Bradley Faskowitz,"If you have other health insurance, you can get that fee rescinded if you apply for a fee waiver.  I think it is due on the 15th.  I can send anyone the link who needs it."
William Otte,I mean would you know what Kleenex if it weren't for them? 
Emma Birdsong,Mucinex ain't cheap
Gas Pedal,Like wtf. All the student health center ever does is send you home with a Kleenex.
Gas Pedal,Did you guys know that student health insurance went up $500 from our freshman year to our sophomore year?
William Otte,I know I'm in Morgan or Lewis. Just not which one 
William Otte,I'd take building tbh 
Gas Pedal,Doesn't have a room number though
William Otte,Thanks 
William Otte,Oh yeahhhhhh I'll look. 
Gas Pedal,meals.vanderbilt.edu
Gas Pedal,It was through your meal plan
Emma Birdsong,I just remember there was a way before freshman year that everyone was able to find their housing assignments before they were officially sent out and I think it was on some bill somewhere 
William Otte,I looked around in YES 
Emma Birdsong,I think there might be a way to check in billing somehow. 
William Otte,I did. Sadly it hasn't 
Gas Pedal,Check people finder and see if it's been updated yet
I have a LISP,Ha yeah you would never like lisp haha
Danny's Arch Nemesis,Definitely Danny. I would never say any of that.
Danny McClanahan,hack the database
William Otte,Cuz like I can't remember. 
William Otte,"Unrelated topic, does anyone know how to find your room number for next year? "
I have a LISP,Haha I laughed so hard when I saw that response 
I have a LISP,Or maybe @Danny's Arch Nemesis 
I have a LISP,"Was this you on the vandyapps survey @mc clanahan ? ""i wanted to check the lisp box, but I wanted to say f*** your types JavaScript is the shit"""
Danny McClanahan,jesus that was a joke emma everyone needs to lighten the fuck up
Emma Birdsong,
Emma Birdsong,"Lol what you said was problematic, him pointing it out doesn't count as bullying "
Danny McClanahan,Oh yeah danny way to bully me on facebook
mc clanahan,like i said the dude was a fuckin legend
Bradley Faskowitz,The one that died in 1952?  The one that was reincarnated in 2005 for the sole purpose of completing the double ssh?  That Ronnie Jacobs?
mc clanahan,"the dead one, duh"
Bradley Faskowitz,Which one?
mc clanahan,the free breakfast at my hotel is a ton better if you get to it earlier
mc clanahan,"implying I was ""down"""
mc clanahan,"""up"""
Bradley Faskowitz,Why the hell are you up so early.  Don't you usually get to work around 11 or 12 lol.
mc clanahan,and he's dead now so I guess you're number one
mc clanahan,that shit's legendary dude the only other guy I've ever heard of doing it was ronnie jacobs in 05
mc clanahan,dude you pulled a double ssh??? did you get it on camera?
Bradley Faskowitz,This probably happens all the time but I just did a double ssh and I feel really great about myself because of it.
Emma Birdsong,OMG is that Guy Fieri's couch?!
Conor Joplin,"Fun fact: the KKK has adopted highways before, but people would steal the signs every time they were put up (who doesn't want a sign saying ""Adopted by the KKK""?) and they eventually revoked it"

mc clanahan,they had a show in seattle recently so I thought it was a good shot
mc clanahan,I did ask for death grips
hoegrammer,it'd be legendary to say the least 
hoegrammer,DEF get death grips to play at the Microsoft event
mc clanahan,faskowitz is a pretty weird name too ngl
hoegrammer,wait hold up. death grips is from Sacramento which isn't TOO far
Bradley Faskowitz,"Whoa, Elton is such a weird name.  Have you ever thought about that?  Elton.  "
mc clanahan,my mom loves Elton
Bradley Faskowitz,#wewantelton 
Bradley Faskowitz,I know best buy had Elton John at a corporate event.  Get Elton.
mc clanahan,it would be rad
hoegrammer,might be kind of weird to have up-and-coming rappers at a Microsoft signature event but it could also be cool
hoegrammer,like Sol and Blue Scholars
hoegrammer,also Seattle is supposed to have a pretty cool rap scene
mc clanahan,so I'm assuming they don't wanna do it again
mc clanahan,they had deadmau5 and macklemore last year

hoegrammer,this entire chat is just engineers trying to prove to engineers that engineers party
mc clanahan,the only female on my side of the building was an intern last year
mc clanahan,max I'm more impressed by the fact that there is a woman in your workplace
🍆,Confidential**
Max Care,"And I learned some interesting things, like the fact that my friends mentor is sleeping with her boss. "
🍆,Nooooo thats confidentiañ
Emma Birdsong,Nobody goes as hard as 🍆 tho
Max Care,"So I went to a partly last night that was all Microsoft FTEs. I have to say, they go pretty fucking hard. "
mc clanahan,"ladies will swoon ""he's so misunderstood"" they'll say"
mc clanahan,yeah dude whenever you want to seem deep and enigmatic you can just spout one of the trademark compiler error messages
Phillip Hawkins,I've learned so much from him
mc clanahan,we can all thank will otte really
mc clanahan,and they say there isn't enough engineering talent
Emma Birdsong,Just got to put my CS knowledge to good use! Helped a friend's grandad clean out his Facebook inbox and unfriend a dead guy (-:
Sam Zeppos,Yasss 
William Otte,J
mc clanahan,I would rather stick a rake up my ass
hoegrammer,Microsoft Wallet
hoegrammer,or OneDrive
hoegrammer,if you have brand loyalty do you also use bing
mc clanahan,yo jeff do you wanna comment on being banned from crapp development
mc clanahan,and it's hot outside
mc clanahan,and like I already had the app open
mc clanahan,"groupme is Microsoft property, I'm showing brand loyalty"
Conor Joplin,What's texting anyway? I don't know what that is I just Groupme everything
mc clanahan,dope I'm down
Max Care,If you want. 
Max Care,Nah it's a one time thing. And I can pick you up. 
mc clanahan,also I ran my bike into a wall and it's fucked up now
mc clanahan,intern thread implies it's an intern social group thing so I might wait until mine does it
Max Care,"(Also with nerf guns, no actual dying involved)"
Max Care,Hunger games but with like 100+ interns and around commons. Its at 9pm at the commons mixer tonight.
mc clanahan,fuck is that
Max Care,Are you going to the hunger games thing tonight?
Max Care,"Yeah, we have it off. "
mc clanahan,yo @Max Care people aren't coming to work tomorrow right
mc clanahan,some asshole I used to know showed it to me like it was the best thing in the world
mc clanahan,there is if you wanna install an extension in chrome or firefox
Phillip Hawkins,but like why isn't there a dislike button
Mark,Hat the fuck I give up
Mark,Islike
Mark,Disloke
Mark,Disloke
Danny's Arch Nemesis,People keep giving us suggestions for adding things on Facebook. NO WE'RE NOT ADDING A FUCKING DISLIKE BUTTON
Bradley Faskowitz,She actually asked me if a computer science major was the same thing as IT ...
dοpe ass motherfucker,"Ugh. That's been driving me nuts this summer. ""I fucking hate and am not IT"" I won't remove your virus and really don't want to troubleshoot the network. "
Bradley Faskowitz,"Last night, I was on a plane talking to a lady.  I told her I was a computer science major, and would check how fast the wifi would be on the plane (sometimes it's really slow).  Over time she kept on asking me computer questions like why is the wifi not working in the first place to connect to the American Airlines website (her wifi was off and needed to turn it on).  At one point, she found the wifi to be $21.50 for the whole flight.  Quickly, she asked me, ""Oh, wait, can I use my mobile hotspot on my phone to connect to the Internet.""  --""no ma'am, you need cell service to do that"""

Max Care,"Too late. Gotta get that sweet, sweet, bonus. "
mc clanahan,don't fuck me over max
mc clanahan,no actually there are posters on the wall telling you to turn in your comrades for conduct unbefitting an employee
Phillip Hawkins,^are you allowed to say bad things about bill gates?
mc clanahan,too bad we're not actually in the 80s then I could beat up ol billy gates and tell him to make less shitty computers
mc clanahan,nice that's almost fast enough to pretend we're stuck in the 80s
Max Care,Which is sort of better than no WiFi?
Max Care,"Its also 90 here, but our WiFi is like 200 kb/s "
hoegrammer,use your voice. make a change. write a shitty yelp review. 
mc clanahan,the fuck
Max Care,"I would invite you over, but Matt's parents are here and using the car. "
mc clanahan,yeah I think I read that somewhere
Phillip Hawkins,I think hell is like that
mc clanahan,my hotel room is 90 degrees and I have no wifi someone kill me
mc clanahan,*snaps*
hoegrammer,isn't that what all tech does
mc clanahan,he's trying to replace you with a plastic robot slave? 
hoegrammer,the tech evangelist is chill tho he's using a kinect to 3D print models of all of us
hoegrammer,tl;dr computers are rad but image recognition is just nuts
mc clanahan,the problem with google's thing is that it's active research presented as a finished product
Mark,The problem with googles thing is that it generalized too much. It probably never had to distinguish between gorillas and black people because specifically training it to do so would be more racist than the ai mixing them up on accident
hoegrammer,yeah I mean obviously it IS better in some way or they wouldn't have made that claim. like I can't tell the difference between two bar codes but clearly a scanner can
Max Care,"(I made up the 100x part, I actually have no idea)"
Conor Joplin,Wait there are people besides straight white dudes?
Max Care,"Also, the claim of it being better than humans isn't that tenuous, if they were talking about specific categories. Like face recognition. Computers are just as accurate, and like 100 times faster. "
hoegrammer,turns out it was only tested on dudes
hoegrammer,I know last year some girls at a camp were having trouble implementing voice recognition software until they dropped the pitch of their voice a ton
mc clanahan,average human at google is white male so
hoegrammer,"did their initial data set for ""people"" not include pictures of black people or"
mc clanahan,"but people want it now, damn it"
Mark,No that's the cool thing. So you can learn and research but also make money 
mc clanahan,so it takes a long time to understand a lot of the research because it's complex and still developing
mc clanahan,the problem with machine learning is that it's both academic and corporate
Mark,"Yeah very silly claim. I disagree with danny. I am in the computer biz sp one day i can make an ai and play god. But did anyone see googles I photos thinking black people were gorillas and Google said ""holy fuck"""
mc clanahan,possibly satanic
mc clanahan,overhyped
mc clanahan,it's useless
mc clanahan,fuck machine vision
hoegrammer,"yeah, but the claim that they're ""better than humans"" now is pretty misleading"
Mark,"I mean it's getting better, you don't have to shit on it"
Mark,Yup
hoegrammer,I mean animal vision as in including humans?
Mark,About the copying natural world thing. Neural networks are so useful because it models the brain in that it learns the same way for any sense whether it be sight or hearing or whatever. So who cares how animals see
mc clanahan,the number of credits for cs majors here is literally ridiculous
mc clanahan,amped as fcuk
hoegrammer,I can't take it bc I have no space in my schedule... 18 credits till I graduate who's pumped?????
hoegrammer,oh jk
hoegrammer,bodenheimer?
mc clanahan,laibinis and I are homies
mc clanahan,I was gonna do scicomp cause the guy who teaches it is rad
Max Care,I would take it if you taught it Danny. I'd probably have to record ever lecture and play it back at 1/4 speed though. 
hoegrammer,I would actually totally take a scientific computing class if it counted for shit in the CS major
mc clanahan,I'll fucking teach 201 how about that
mc clanahan,201 is the reason I'm in cs tairas doesn't deserve to spit on roth's shoes
hoegrammer,I feel 0 guilt
hoegrammer,he totally knew too... because he also sat in on Roth's class and took notes to lecture off of later
mc clanahan,literally cannot believe he was allowed to sully the good name of roth's 201
mc clanahan,^clutch move
hoegrammer,remember when I took his 201 class and only went to Roth's section except for test days
Emma Birdsong,JUST DO IT..maybe..if you feel like it.. *said into the board*
Emma Birdsong,I want to see Tairas do a TEDtalk. 
hoegrammer,(help me.........)
hoegrammer,I love my majors...
hoegrammer,looool I'm so excited
Emma Birdsong,Took  tairas's MATLAB class irl. Was awful. 
mc clanahan,the thought of more tairas makes me want to shove me head in a used toilet and drink deeply
mc clanahan,LOL tairas
mc clanahan,like yes knowing one implies the other but you can have image recognition without copying the natural world
hoegrammer,ALSO I'm coding for a neuro lab for research credit this year and have to learn MatLab so I'm taking Tairas's coursera course #blessed
mc clanahan,ok but we don't have to know how animal vision works to make a neural net that works
hoegrammer,and mark I'm not sure but my neuro professor showed us that picture sooo idk
hoegrammer,"yeah that's why current deep neural networks kind of suck in practice since we haven't even really figured out how animal image recognition works when viewpoints change (lighting, angles, etc)"
Mark,I thought that the gorilla I'm your image was classified as a gorilla then the AI changed the picture to look more like what a gorilla looks like
mc clanahan,ai is pseudoscience
I have a LISP,Oh odd
Max Care,"IIRC, the school bus was modified by the neural net that classified it originally, with the intent of making it look like something else. Its like an optical illusion, but one that doesn't make sense to people. "
I have a LISP,"That's because training a neural network based on an image naturally takes into account the position. The general solution to that problem is to move things around in the image when you're trying to find a match, but that takes a long time"
I have a LISP,I believe that's because neural networks have trouble identifying two identical images if the subject has been moved in the photo.
hoegrammer,school bus on the left is a school bus. school bus on the right is an ostrich. aight
hoegrammer,"well according to one deep neural network (I forget which company's), this is a gorilla so"
mc clanahan,fucking sick burn bro
I have a LISP,Maybe she meant to say that it's smarter than tech evangelists
hoegrammer,image recognition*
hoegrammer,"also cannot deal with the title ""tech evangelist"" who r u"
hoegrammer,tbh the main reason there isn't any good image software is because we still don't know how people recognize images
Emma Birdsong,Depends on your human sample 
Mark,At least it doesn't think black people are gorillas
William Otte,I'm highly skeptical.
hoegrammer,#fuckyourmachinelearning
I have a LISP,Lol
hoegrammer,I just gave a lecture on why it sucks
hoegrammer,Microsoft tech evangelist tried to tell my students that their image recognition computer is now better than humans
William Otte,Good . I don't like it. 
mc clanahan,you might scare it away
mc clanahan,the computer is doing something
mc clanahan,ssh
William Otte,Mine isn't 
Emma Birdsong,"""Computer is doing something"" "

William Otte,"The problem is my idiot friends have a tendency to shout about how high they are around my parents, so I turned it into a joke (lol they're so dumb, they must be high) to convince my parents my friends weren't actually high they were kidding cuz someone was being silly. Now its leaked into my life. "
William Otte,Legitimately entirely kidding 
William Otte,I'm not actually I'm joking. 
dοpe ass motherfucker,I just don't know why you're so intent on him being a stoner when Aaron didn't mention it and he clearly is a cheater
William Otte,That sounded way harsher than I meant 
William Otte,Cuz I also know several stoners who are just dumb as bricks all the time 
William Otte,Yeah maybe this guy wasn't one of those 
dοpe ass motherfucker,I feel like we all know a few stoners that are super smart even while high all the time. 
William Otte,Eh is cheating more likely than weed? Idk 
dοpe ass motherfucker,"Or, more likely, he cheated. "

I have a LISP,And Indiana has a very good graduate program too

William Otte,Wow
I have a LISP,We gave him an offer on the spot! /s
William Otte,So the person was just googling the answers cuz they weren't in the building 
I have a LISP,We later found the integer solution on stack overflow as well.
I have a LISP,Phone screen.
I have a LISP,"Somewhat amused at the candidates cheating, my teammate remembered that on the first question, which was to check if a string is a palindrome, the candidate came up with a very elegant solution for the (more difficult) problem of determining if an integer is a palindrome. When asked to convert the problem to strings, the candidate struggled. Looking back, it all began to make sense...."
William Otte,Was this a live interview? 
I have a LISP,"A guy on my team interviewed a candidate today. He asked a string manipulation problem where you have a string that represents a path on Linux, e.g. ""~/foo/bar/baz"". Question is to implement a few commands, the first being cd, to manipulate that string. After 10 minutes of nothing, the candidate wrote a 30-40 line bash script (already wth worthy) that calls the commands cd and ls and stuff. Somewhat impressed with the candidates bash abilities, but confused that the script didn't really solve the problem at hand, my teammate came back and told us this story. We started googling around, and sure enough, on the 3rd or 4th answer down on a random Linux shell question, there was the candidates script."

Mark,Idk I'll let you know when I'm 40
Mark,Like...Lots of them. That's why it's illegal. Because they're bad at choices.

William Otte,"What 18 year old girl is gonna go ""yeah sure random 40 year old with 5 wives, let's go tie the knot!"""
William Otte,I mean not now 
Mark,Isn't it easier to convince minors to marry you?
Conor Joplin,You could walk up to anyone in America and ask 'Do you know Joe Smith?' and they will say 'Probably'
I have a LISP,"You have a to be a boss to convince 12 or so women to marry you, especially when many of them already had husbands and some were minors."
Conor Joplin,Dude has the most generic name possible of course people know who he is
William Otte,That's kinda like winning. Hes certainly well known
William Otte,He founded a massive cult 
William Otte,I mean to be fair 
Mark,"Actually in this case it was written by a cult leader, nevermind"
Mark,History is written by the winners
Who?,And I bet they're all married to the same guy
I have a LISP,"Fun fact: there are 3 women in the Book of Mormon (my copy is over 500 pages long) and one of the women is a whore. Remember, this book covers 1000 years (600BC to 400AD) of early American history."
mc clanahan,today is the worst day ever

mc clanahan,cumpooters is the highlight of my day
Max Care,"""Cumpooters,"" always a source of enlightening discussion. "
hoegrammer,"obviously, not really great records"
hoegrammer,I mean Jewish religion goes back as far as 400-1200BC or so
Mark,"My point is since their culture relied on the people actually existing they had to keep them alive and having babies. Like, roman and greek culture were and are very pervasive because they didn't care who you were born to"
I have a LISP,*Woops
I have a LISP,Woods
I have a LISP,"^speaking of which, the part of the Book of Mormon I'm reading has a ton of passages about converting people to Judaism and was supposedly written in... 590BC"
hoegrammer,"well yeah, evangelism isn't really their thing"
I have a LISP,I would be very surprised if that were true.
Mark,"I read that ensuring procreation was the only thing keeping the Hebrews alive. They had no kingdom, no math, etc and treated themselves like gods chosen people and wouldn't breed with others. So things like homosexuality, masturbating, and pulling out were forbidden. Something like that, idgaf"
GroupMe,dope ass motherfucker changed name to mc clanahan
hoegrammer,even with Black Americans the issue is a lot more complicated because of race and heteromasculinity AYY
dope ass motherfucker,^^^^^^^^^^^
Conor Joplin,They gave more fucks to* their cows
dope ass motherfucker,most people couldn't even read in 1000 bc I feel like they probs gave more fucks about the health of their cows
hoegrammer,oh ofc this analysis really only applies to US white Christian history
Mark,What about during antiquity?
hoegrammer,a*
hoegrammer,the concept of same-sex attraction as an sexuality is relatively new
hoegrammer,"I mean up until the early 1900's homosexuality was just considered another aberrant sexual act, like adultery or premarital sex"
dope ass motherfucker,:)
I have a LISP,"@Conor Joplin Oh totally. It's the official stance of my own church, though we allow condoms :)"
dope ass motherfucker,my headphones just broke fuck this
Max Care,@I have a LISP Everyone knows you don't need to be educated on the topic to have a totally entrenched opinion that you violently defend. Haven't you ever been on the internet?
Conor Joplin,"Sorry I'm a tad (pretty) drunk rn, but that's the official stance of the Catholic church and most other Christian churches. The official understanding is that you should love everyone refardless of race/sexuality/whatever else, but that homosexual acts are a sin because they cannot lead to children, which is the point of sex. Besically it's about as bad as using a condom/BC"
I have a LISP,Sorry for blasting the channel guyz... It's good to vent though :)
dope ass motherfucker,well that's refreshing
I have a LISP,"Oh and to answer your question Danny, against gay marriage, some Mormons are against gays in general but that's a cultural thing. The churches official stance is that you have to stay chaste."
I have a LISP,"Of course, his economic theory is ultra conservative. He's totally against welfare and any form of gvmt provided healthcare, which is nuts."
I have a LISP,He's super super smart.
I have a LISP,"Funny thing is, my roommate who thinks that stuff is a total stud in economics and has already gone to two conferences this summer to present papers on taxation policy. Sounds like he has a legit shot at a top grad school too."
dope ass motherfucker,lol religion
I have a LISP,"On the contrary, my programmer coworkers and much more fair about it. Their big concern is that their temples will be forced to do gay marriages (which is a totally legitimate concern)."
Mark,Maybe they haven't paid any attention to the other countries that allow gay marriage
I have a LISP,"Because it ""encourages sin."""
I have a LISP,He literally thinks that society will have more crime and crumble apart if gays can marry.
I have a LISP,"It varies person to person, but my estimate is that 90% of the Mormons here in Utah are vehemently against legalization of gay marriage. As my roommate so aptly explained, ""society will be less moral and therefore less stable and ready for Jesus to return if we allow gay marriage."" "

I have a LISP,@Max Care How can I disagree with their religion if I haven't read their holy book?
I have a LISP,Yeah my roommates and one of my coworkers go on that many dates. It's absurd

dope ass motherfucker,cause he went out with 5 different girls at once!!!!

hoegrammer,my friend at BYU goes on like 3-4 dates every weekend 
hoegrammer,dating is serious shit though
Mark,Aw that's nice of them
Conor Joplin,"To be fair, Mormons take all the shit they get really well. I worked with a few last year and they joked around with me about it, and instead of getting outraged about The Book of Mormon they just asked the actors to tell the audience to donate to AIDS prevention in Africa and handed out LDS flyers outside the theater, at least in St. Louis"
Emma Birdsong,^those sound like types of flooring

dope ass motherfucker,have they invited you to one of their dances yet
I have a LISP,"My roommate keeps asking me if I've ""felt the spirit"" while reading it and I'm like no f*** you."

Danny's Arch Nemesis,We actually had to sit through that at facebook
Emma Birdsong,👏👏👏👏
hoegrammer, usually I'd be bitter but I feel like these guys could use the extra 27 cents for like social skills coaching or something
Emma Birdsong,And someone is going to pay those people more than they pay us 
hoegrammer,I literally cannot think of anything I care less about than your previous haircare routine
dope ass motherfucker,sounds like a group of children well adjusted to society and human contact
hoegrammer,"people I met at Internapalooza:
- the very average-haired rando who stopped me to ask how long it takes me to do my hair in the morning. when I told him I just brushed it, he was like ""no, how long does it take to dry??? when my hair was chin length it took like two whole minutes and I HATED it."" I said ""I don't know.""
- the kid in front of me who insisted that the Airbnb recruiter take two of his resume because ""it's just that good."" when I started talking to her and said I didn't bring a resume, he was like, ""here, just give her mine!!""
- the kid who grabbed like 5 Palantir shirts without talking to any of the recruiters and just walked away.
- the dickwad who waited in the BlackRock line for straight up 5 minutes before he was all ""wait. This isn't Yahoo"" (Yahoo was next booth over). Asked me what BlackRock was, and when I explained, was like, ""well, I should really be talking to the big companies like Yahoo and VMware,"" and left."

🍆,I feel like this is a good metaphor for perl 
Danny McClanahan,I guess I just have a terrible memory
dope ass motherfucker,I remembered the name and put that into this great site called google
I have a LISP,The truth comes out
Danny McClanahan,whoa danny how did you find that
dope ass motherfucker,whale guts
Danny's Arch Nemesis,My manager last summer was a figure in the perl community and I kinda had a man crush on him so by extension I <3 perl
dope ass motherfucker,https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/tour-de-babel
Danny McClanahan,"Anna Hwang and I read this article by this Amazon guy that totally convinced me why ruby is better than Perl, but I can't find it"
I have a LISP,"Terrible language was too strong, but I stand by using Python or Ruby for scripting unless there is a serious need for Perl (like guaranteed installs on many machines)."
Danny McClanahan,"I've written at least 100 lines of all three of those, and I like Perl the least"
William Otte,The internet is known for being never wrong 
I have a LISP,All of 0 lines. I'm channeling internet comments rn
dope ass motherfucker,it's also fast as fuck in comparison
dope ass motherfucker,dude how many lines of perl have you written it's seriously not bad
I have a LISP,Perl
I have a LISP,Well you can write good software in C but that doesn't mean that you should. There aren't many good reasons to use peel when Python and Ruby exist.
dope ass motherfucker,I use it for all my zsh config scripting cause its package manager is reliable and you can write super complex and fast scripts in just a few lines
dope ass motherfucker,"I wouldn't call it a terrible language. i would call it fucking disgusting to look at and it's got quirks like automatically flattening every list, but you can write good software with it"
I have a LISP,"But it's also a terrible language when it comes down to it. It's a ""Write only language"""
dope ass motherfucker,sometimes used in bioinformatics cause of text stuff
dope ass motherfucker,it looks fucking disgusting though

dοpe ass motherfucker,What'd he say?
dope ass motherfucker,so against my expectations the israeli did not krav maga me to incapacitation
dοpe ass motherfucker,Update: just got off the last river for our 3day camping/kayaking trip. Going to get tacos then back to camp. Sounds like y'all are having fun too. 
Mark,Oh no you have to switch to eclipse

Max Care,"Oh man, I wish I could be doing programming problems by hand. Instead I'm getting paid to drink beer and watch avengers. "
Mark,Maybe we'll get an honorary verizon phd
Danny's Arch Nemesis,Man why are they making interns do this? don't they have people with graph theory phDs and stuff?
Mark,"It's an interesting problem, I just wish I had taken algorithms and AI already"
Mark,Not without computing it with Google maps
William Otte,Are the distances not known? 
Mark,"So we have 400 locations and you can travel anywhere obviously, so you'd have to measure distance between all 399 other points. I don't get it."
dope ass motherfucker,this group is a clique
Connor Joplin,Are you saying that the graph is a clique?
William Otte,Search for the shortest edges? 
Mark,"Question: since every vertex is connected in my problem, how do you narrow it down to a few vertices with shorter edges to pick from?"
I have a LISP,Screw SV
I have a LISP,"That's like what investment banks do to test their interns, but at least there you get paid overtime"
I have a LISP,Oh well then that's bullshit get out of there
William Otte,Lol that's annoying
Danny's Arch Nemesis,"Except we're salaried so its literally ""let's see which interns are willing to put in 8 extra hours today"""
I have a LISP,easy $$
I have a LISP,Nice
Danny's Arch Nemesis,Ya I gave up after 2 hours and just played foosball/karaoke instead
I have a LISP,Overtime?
Mark,Yikes no I want to play outside
Danny's Arch Nemesis,Facebook had its 8 hour intern hackathon conveniently at 6pm
Mark,No its during business hours
Danny's Arch Nemesis,Is your intern hackathon overtime?
I have a LISP,"""If you solve this problem, you get a full time offer at Verizon (and a Nobel prize)."""
Mark,There are like 400 locations and the algorithm must pick the best ones
Mark,"Yeah sort of. But we don't want to visit every point, just the ones which will give the most points. I feel like a genetic algorithm could determine that but idk"
I have a LISP,So it's a modified traveling salesman 
Mark,Yep. And we can use Google api
I have a LISP,Oh so there _are_ distances
Mark,"Yeah so like verizon places are 10 pts, NBA stadiums are 8 pts, each state is 3 pts, etc. Given 224 hours, 1 hour at each place, constant 65 mph. "
I have a LISP,There has to be a cost for going to the cities right? Or it's not a hard problem
I have a LISP,Or just point values for the best cities?
I have a LISP,Does the question have distances between the places?
Connor Joplin,Tell them to split the first vertex. Problem solved
Connor Joplin,This is clearly a Hamilton cycle problem 
I have a LISP,Do you only choose a few of the best places?
Emma Birdsong,Spinrad is gonna change your grade 
I have a LISP,Update: Aaron skimmed and misidentified question as a traveling salesmen problem 
I have a LISP,Lol NPC
Mark,"So verizon is doing an intern ""hackathon"" but they gave us all the same problem where we are given a list of places with different point values to visit and we have to find the best route to visit the best places. We're literally doing it all by hand. "

dοpe ass motherfucker,Ergh!
dοpe ass motherfucker,"Sorry. Was at dinner. So we were out of boats my size, so I had to squeeze into one that was way too small. "
Danny's Arch Nemesis,What a tease

dope ass motherfucker,what kind of boat was it
William Otte,Tell us Turner 
dοpe ass motherfucker,Yall would not believe the boat I had to paddle today. 
Bradley Faskowitz,"^yea, that was actually probably one of the stupidest points I have ever made and I'm sorry you spend the time reading that"
Bradley Faskowitz,Some people have different talents 
I have a LISP,But it's not me...
I have a LISP,His name is Aaron 
I have a LISP,I'm pretty sure one guy on my team of 4 writes 95% of the new code and everyone else just fixes bugs.
Mark,"They've been really understanding of my view that verizon sucks, let's change it."
dope ass motherfucker,hahaha mark
dope ass motherfucker,brad I guess the reason I wouldn't call it a paradigm change is because people have been using non javascript languages for a while with transpilers and whatnot
Mark,"Wow. Boy am I glad I've been building my app from scratch! Although, I still don't have access to anything and have just been modifying their framework theme to look like android..."
dope ass motherfucker,seriously though when I started playing with atom I just cloned react and included that instead of the minified so I could debug more easily
dope ass motherfucker,I was going to ask if there waa documentation but then I remembered this is microsoft
dope ass motherfucker,you can't work directly off the unminified source?
Danny's Arch Nemesis,Classic msoft
dope ass motherfucker,what the fuck
Max Care,"It's enough to say that anytime my code has an error, the back trace is 20 calls deep(all minified names) and ends in my code being called with eval. "
I have a LISP,"I better start working on my haskell to webassembly compiler. And yes, it will integrate with haskshell"
Bradley Faskowitz,"Well, I mean, the paradigm is that JavaScript is the end all be all, but here is an alternative, which still uses much of the same stuff but is still different"
Max Care,"Which reminds me Danny, I need to tell you about the abomination of a js framework that I have to work in. "
dope ass motherfucker,I mean idk about a change in paradigm it seems like they're really just making a fast form of javascript; it's still gonna be distributed and run in basically the same way
Bradley Faskowitz,"It'd be a change in paradigm, so I guess it's a big deal in that respect"
dope ass motherfucker,languages are dumb massive projects
dope ass motherfucker,formats are easy to hack around with
dope ass motherfucker,I really like that it's a format and not a language
Bradley Faskowitz,This was just posted in the hackathon hackers group on Facebook but I'd thought I'd share because it could be a pretty big deal: http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/17/google-microsoft-mozilla-and-others-team-up-to-launch-webassembly-a-new-binary-format-for-the-web/?ncid=rss&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29&utm_content=FaceBook

Max Care,Alan: Two months
William Otte,He sounds like he's a good worker! 
Max Care,So he also spent a good portion of today on the phone. I took off my headphones(mistake) and heard him talking about how their kids won't get sick because they'll have good genetics. 
William Otte,Also he recently started dating her and was shopping for engagement rings? 
William Otte,Max come on! Letting the team down 
hoegrammer,watched Napoleon Dynamite a few too many times
Max Care,I'll keep you guys updated from now on. There's something new every day. 
dope ass motherfucker,^
Mark,Whoa why have you not told us stories until now?
Max Care,"So the intern I share an office with is one of the strangest people i've ever met. The first day I met him he told me that he recently started dating ""a kinky black woman who gets turned on by white nerdy guys"".

I have a LISP,We can slap the VandyApps name on it too (and Vandy cs?)
William Otte,Cuz we hate fun and having professors
I have a LISP,Why not?
William Otte,No we won't sign it
I have a LISP,Oh god I just restarted 
I have a LISP,I can write it if you will help me get sigs

Danny's Arch Nemesis,"It was Yale, danny and I were going to get started but then I got lazy"
William Otte,Yuh
Max Care,I'd help with that. 
Mark,"Oh I forgot to mention, doug Schmidt talked about some cs kids at harvard(?) sending a letter to the administration saying hire more cs faculty and wanted us to do that too "
I have a LISP,Second time that's happened here
I have a LISP,Lol all the bands I see say they're from Nashville and I'm the only one in the crowd who cheers for thay
I have a LISP,
dope ass motherfucker,wtf
I have a LISP,And I'm in the back 
I have a LISP,Guys I'm literally 10 ft from the stage
I have a LISP,Lol
Emma Birdsong,The first VandyApps meeting I went to someone proposed making an app that helps you remember when your clubs are meeting. It was amazing. 
dope ass motherfucker,~~cs love~~
dope ass motherfucker,yeah I think we're definitely all agreed on that
I have a LISP,"It's not a zero sum game... If we help each other, we help ourselves. "
I have a LISP,"The moral of the story is, yes, you can improve Vanderbilt cs outcome, and the most surefire way to do that is by coming to and supporting the Vanderbilt programming community at VandyApps!"
Bradley Faskowitz,"And yes, there is a lack of institutional funding in the CS department and this is something we should change."
Bradley Faskowitz,"And the Harvard thing is bullshit because everyone assumes that someone who goes to Harvard is a genius, when really, that isn't true.  Only a select few are admitted on sheer brilliance."
Bradley Faskowitz,"Well one of the reasons why they recruit at a place like gt is because they just have so many more students, meaning that even if there are fewer quality students by percent, there are way more by numbers.  Same with a Michigan or a Berkeley.  More students, more talent in the pool.  "
dope ass motherfucker,like the reason I'm insistent on thus is because this is something **we** can change
dope ass motherfucker,all my friends at harvard got microsoft after their frosh year
dope ass motherfucker,brad that sounds great but we're totally not on equal playing field
Emma Birdsong,"Thanks for the pep talk, coach!"
Bradley Faskowitz,"But sometimes you just have to go after it rather than let them go after you.  If you show that you have more motivation than an average 5th grade prepubescent in trying to pursue opportunities, you will be on an equal if not better playing field.  As long as you've got the talent to back it up, you'll do fine."
Conor Joplin,
Bradley Faskowitz,^this is a good point.
dope ass motherfucker,the fact that nobody really gives a fuck about recruiting vandy kids is evidence that it's not respected in computer science
dope ass motherfucker,the average gt student couldn't get in to vandy
dope ass motherfucker,ok but relying on stats is misleading
Emma Birdsong,Honestly my biggest concern is who is recruiting us but I think that is gonna get better with time 
Bradley Faskowitz,"To be honest, it doesn't look much different, we are just on a smaller scale"
Bradley Faskowitz,"It's hard to see, but here are their career outcomes"
Bradley Faskowitz,"For reference, this is Georgia tech's college of computing, which is ranked in the top 10, top 5 in some polls, which hosts computer science"
dope ass motherfucker,fuck money
Emma Birdsong,Also you're forgetting that vanderbilt has more women in engineering than most schools so that probably fcks up the average salary too sry
dope ass motherfucker,ew children
Emma Birdsong,I'm just trying to graduate so I can pop out babies like my grandma wants 
Terrified of groupme pic,According to my mom my goal should be wearing more makeup and marrying rich so like seems to align well with the statistic
dope ass motherfucker,no but it's also silly to act like vandy is at all respected as a school for cs
🍆,Says the art major
Danny's Arch Nemesis,and it's not like working at the big 5 should be the end goal for everybody
Bradley Faskowitz,9/30 at the big 5 sounds pretty solid to me.
Danny's Arch Nemesis,i think those numbers are alright
Bradley Faskowitz,"I hate to be the positivity guy, now, but..."
Danny's Arch Nemesis,"ya in the class of 2015, which has around 30 or so people, there are 4 at microsoft, 1 at apple, 2 at google, and 2 at fb, and that's just the people i know"
Bradley Faskowitz,"Yea, I know nothing."
Bradley Faskowitz,"Wait, but let's make him count though... I think Jeff would help the cause .."
Emma Birdsong,There were ~30 in this year's graduating class
Bradley Faskowitz,"But what do I know?  I haven't technically declared a CS major yet.  lol
"
Max Care,You don't count. 
Max Care,Not you Jeff. 
Max Care,I think our class is going to do a lot better though. 
Bradley Faskowitz,"But really, I hear the CS program is in the ballpark of 80, and about 20 or so responses seem to have been recorded.  There is a lot of uncertainty there."
Bradley Faskowitz,It was more a matter of rhetoric than assuming you cannot read lol
Danny's Arch Nemesis,Also their class size is 24 lolololol
Emma Birdsong,What would you want to see Danny? I think I'm just thrilled to see almost everyone be employed or going to grad school haha
dope ass motherfucker,I'm gonna assume that's most people though
dope ass motherfucker,I can read brad
Bradley Faskowitz,"""Those are only the stats of people who actually said where they were going, too, so not all outcomes are represented"""
dope ass motherfucker,a single grad school? one to amazon apple and 2 to msft??? guys we gotta do something
dope ass motherfucker,wow that's shittier than I expected
Bradley Faskowitz,"Those are only the stats of people who actually said where they were going, too, so not all outcomes are represented"
Emma Birdsong,"http://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/docs/VUSE-Class-of-2014-Placement-Summary.pdf
Compared to other majors we do well but idk how we compare nationally "
dope ass motherfucker,"how do vandy grads ""do well"""
dope ass motherfucker,what does that percentage come out to
dope ass motherfucker,how many students?
dope ass motherfucker,how many people did we send to google? facebook? microsoft? 
Emma Birdsong,You wanna talk to an 8th grader from rural TN about why he should come to vandy then?
dope ass motherfucker,since when do vandy grads do well lo
Bradley Faskowitz,Fuck I'm really good at ruining a thread that was funny..
Bradley Faskowitz,*In the classic brad tone* I'm always about the positivity guyzz
Gas Pedal,but that's why we love you <3
Gas Pedal,Brad always with the positivity!
Bradley Faskowitz,"Right, so give this close community more teachers and see what we can be."
Danny's Arch Nemesis,Ya but I think that's because of our close community and good input rather than our schooling
Bradley Faskowitz,Now go back to talking about whales
Bradley Faskowitz,"Yes, Vanderbilt can do more, but the current output only shows that with a greater investment in the program, we can get even better output than our not too bad results already"
Bradley Faskowitz,"Right, Jeff, but also if you look at the output, somehow we still do fine."
Bradley Faskowitz,"Considering our class is around 80, the numbers we get with solid outcomes are great."
Danny's Arch Nemesis,"Oh I can do this: our school has fewer CS teaching and tenure track faculty than any other top 20 school, and we have fewer faculty per student of any top 20 by like 2x the second lowest"
Bradley Faskowitz,"Look, as much as I love shitting on our CS program, our grads tend to do well, and typically better than the average CS department.  Way better actually. "
Max Care,I actually think its likely to get better. I heard they're hiring more faculty. 
William Otte,Guys but do Band-Aids fix bullet holes? 
Emma Birdsong,^valid
Bradley Faskowitz,School*
Bradley Faskowitz,Rankings don't matter when your shook is constantly churning out talent #anchordown
Emma Birdsong,"Speaking of which, someone I graduated with wants her little brother to go to Vanderbilt and he wants to do CS and I'm just like how do I explain why he should look elsewhere without sounding whiny~"
William Otte,Was super interesting 
Bradley Faskowitz,Undergraduates at Vanderbilt tend to do well considering the not so solid reputation.
I have a LISP,Our undergrad has to be better than that 
William Otte,Yup. Read the USDA CA crop report 
I have a LISP,Brad speaking the truth
I have a LISP,Didn't realize that
Bradley Faskowitz,^grad program though. 
Max Care,(We're like 56th for CS)
dope ass motherfucker,#vandy #top20
William Otte,Like you lead the us and its one of the top 20 crops in CA 
William Otte,Y'all make a ton of rice Aaron 
Danny's Arch Nemesis,"Seriously I'm pretty sure I can wade through our ""Rio grande"" "
Emma Birdsong,But New Mexico has Navajo fry bread and I could survive on that alone 
Danny's Arch Nemesis,Heeyyyooooo
Emma Birdsong,Actually that was true starting in NM
Emma Birdsong,"The difference in greenery as I went west was like startling. And everything I saw in CA labeled a ""river"" was what I would call a ditch tbh. "
Mark,Aw that'd be cute 
I have a LISP,Maybe we'll have our own dust bowl
I have a LISP,That's a solid drive
Emma Birdsong,I just drove from TN to CA and the only place I saw rice was Arkansas
I have a LISP,^way to contrivufe
Danny's Arch Nemesis,If ups can ship whales by plane I'm pretty sure flying mules is no problem
I have a LISP,I don't think we make rice alan
I have a LISP,Doesn't California make like a huge portion of the food for the rest of the country
Carl Block,In rancho they're making people pay fines if they use too much water. Pretty sure that won't be effective
William Otte,In a drought don't farm rice n such
William Otte,The problem is what you farm 
I have a LISP,But I want food more than I want a green lawn
Mark,"That's bs, farms are the supermajority of water usage "
I have a LISP,With their lawns 
I have a LISP,That's gonna be hard for all those rich covenant bastards
Max Care,I want to try visiting Cuba some time. 
Carl Block,We're supposed to cut usage by 36% in olivenhain 
I have a LISP,It's been raining non stop in Utah so maybe they can pipe some into SD 
I have a LISP,Is it actually becoming a problem?
Carl Block,Aaron pretty sure there won't be any water left by the time you get here 
I have a LISP,SwiftKey was way more accurate on android
William Otte,I mean maybe they use a 747f variant and just turn the hold into a pasture 
I have a LISP,You can just road trip them
I have a LISP,That's why you should bring those mules to San Diego instwad
Emma Birdsong,Do they put them in cargo? That's inhumane
Max Care,*1000
William Otte,Also a million mules is a lot
Max Care,100 kilo mules?
Emma Birdsong,Is it expensive to fly all those mules?
I have a LISP,747s
William Otte,How do mules fly? 
I have a LISP,It's not as cool as Hawaii but you don't have to fly 1000k mules to get there
Mark,Can I stay in your mansion
dοpe ass motherfucker,I have seen it like at least 15 to 20 times
I have a LISP,Someone visit me in San Diego at the end of the summer 
William Otte,Also turner makes a good point. 
Mark,Uh I think I speak for me and turner when I say we've seen forgetting Sarah Marshall enough to know the spots
dοpe ass motherfucker,"Max, like literally we could just go any direction, find a beach and chill"
William Otte,Max we'll text you

Max Care,"It would suck without me, because you don't know the spots, and no one else is going to show the tourists. "
I have a LISP,Someone come see the mountain goats with me tonight in Salt Lake city

Danny McClanahan,so the colored printers are superior is that what I'm hearing
Rebecca Riley,"Once you hit print, just go to the copiers and print it out"
Rebecca Riley,"You don't select colored. When you get the dialog box on your vuPrint window, it should try to print color for you already"
Tiffany Silverstein,Im a compE so this is even less excusable....
Bradley Faskowitz,"Guyz, I'm a CS major I swear !!! "
Tiffany Silverstein,wait how? Im currently in central and i cant figure out how to select colored

Tiffany Silverstein,"""Always good advice"" from william roundtree otte"
Tiffany Silverstein,

Alan Samanta,His twitter is pure gold 
Danny McClanahan,a hero to us all
Conor Joplin,"Sidenote: If you are ever looking for good BBQ in Nashville, Alabama, Arkansas, St. Louis, or a host of other places, Otte has been kind enough to photo document his journey through those areas and more on his twitter page https://mobile.twitter.com/wrotte/media"
Tiffany Silverstein,"Like ""guys i swear im coming out i just gotta make my code better first"""
Tiffany Silverstein,TRUE
Alan Samanta,Also define hammered 
Conor Joplin,Tiffany remember when we talked about how we had to pregame alone at 12:01 every Friday/Saturday because of 251? Those were the days

Tiffany Silverstein,Being an engineer means drinking alone
Max Kerr,"I'm down, but pregaming at blakemore basically means drinking alone. "
Tiffany Silverstein,Else i will fuck you up danny
Danny McClanahan,else what
Tiffany Silverstein,*if
Tiffany Silverstein,Sidenote i will be angered of you are not all hammered at the fgh mixer tomorrow evening
Danny McClanahan,truuuuuu
Max Kerr,The perk of being a CS major: Nobody gives a shit that you look like a drug dealer/homeless person as long as you can write code. 
Danny McClanahan,fuck yes
Max Kerr,That is the plan
Turner Strayhorn,"max, do this again"
Turner Strayhorn,
Conor Joplin,"It's a lot easier to tear off a grass skirt than sweats, Max"
Max Kerr,I actually know a guy who can do that. Its insane. 
Max Kerr,And it should end with someone doing a backflip and tearing it off while in the air. 
Danny McClanahan,I fucking gagged
Tiffany Silverstein,Yea you're right we should add otte into the dance to tone it down
Turner Strayhorn,Maybe too much. 
Tiffany Silverstein,Or nah
Tiffany Silverstein,Wait can we get the full body tear off sweatsuits and choreograph a dance that involves them and includes a dance solo by danny????? 
Brittany Roth,Why not both?

Danny McClanahan,conor it's cause I'm fucking sexy
Mark Karle,I thought he asked too many damn questions to the professor. But really he asks an ok amount of questions.
Conor Joplin,How?
Conor Joplin,"I thought he was one of those weird antisocial guys, but then he posted a bathroom selfie of him wearing entirely salmon, and 134 people liked it"
Bradley Faskowitz,"#TBT to that time I, like everyone else in 251, thought Danny was a junior"
Alan Samanta,Danny remember visions last year? 
Danny McClanahan,I have many issues and all of them are tiffany silverstein's use of halfway ironic hashtags
Bradley Faskowitz,Now that I know Danny more I've realized that he still has some issues to sort out
Tiffany Silverstein,Danny is this the part where i tell everyone how we met and you were a #playerhater (yes the hashtag is necessary)
Bradley Faskowitz,The first time I met Danny he was my 251 TA and he was helping me learn with command line.  I thought he had some issues to sort out for how much he was swearing
Max Kerr,That's like almost as many real words as swear words. If we count 2...
Max Kerr,"He's also said ""2"" ""best"" and ""hot"". "
Danny McClanahan,is this in any way surprising
Rebecca Riley,"Danny, I think the only contributions you have made to the group thus far have been cursing"
