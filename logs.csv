Professor Thotte,So @I have a LISP when should we come?
Professor Thotte,
‚ö™Ô∏è,I call bullshit
Tuna,Yeah. That's better
fuccboi,"well it costs $25 each, but I would have to charge sales tax and I expect to have extra inventory so I would want like $4 more so I don't get boned at first. What about something like 3 s, 15m, 20l, 2xl"
Tuna,32 seems high for an order of 50. I don't want you stuck with the charge. I would cancel and reduce 
fuccboi,"So I thought there was going to be a final approval screen before ordering 50 1/4 zips and there wasn't so I accidentally submitted an order. Assuming the design would get approved, should I cancel the order or go through or reduce the quantity? Color is a dark grey, would probably charge ~$32 each"

Sam Pepose,Prolog.
Bradley Faskowitz,"I appreciate all the feedback!  Though it sounds kinda weird, my question deal with programming paradigms specifically and how they can benefit a developing mind, so like object-oriented or functional or declarative or something like that.  Also, this is more speculative rather than concrete."
hoegrammer,"if you're trying to teach in Nashville, I think VSVS has a few Lego programming kits that Pat might be willing to loan out"
hoegrammer,Processing can be pretty fun to start out with and Khan Academy has some good tutorials and a decent environment for beginners
hoegrammer,"if you want to work with robots, scribbler bots are pretty easy to work with and you program them using Python on Calico but they're not cheap"
hoegrammer,"as someone who has taught high schoolers, I wouldn't recommend arduino as fun as it is. Even for older kids it's pretty difficult especially to start out with "
GroupMe,Mark added Alan Samanta to the group.

Bradley Faskowitz,"If you were to teach programming to teenagers in school, probably around 13 years old, which programming paradigm would you teach them first and why? (Object oriented, functional, or other).  Note that most of these people won't end up being computer programmers and the purpose of this is make them better at things generally.  If anyone has any thoughts, would love to hear them through any sort of communication method."

Tuna,Yeah I saw people got gcc working on it and Python lite. 
Max Care,"There's a lot more involved in getting it to work, but it's got a little 80MHz CPU on it. You can even use the arduino language to program it if you're the kind of pleb that is frightened by C. "

üöÇüöÉüöÉüöÉüöÉüöÉ,"While the vagina plays a significant role in human and
non-human sexuality, its role with regard to human female sexuality (including
heterosexual and lesbian sexual activity) is especially documented. Less is
known about the vagina of other animals. In human females and a number of other
female mammals, vaginal moisture is increased during sexual arousal by vaginal
lubrication, which reduces friction and allows for smoother penetration of the
vagina during sexual activity. The texture of the vaginal walls create friction
for the penis during sexual intercourse and stimulate it toward ejaculation,
enabling fertilization. In addition, a variety of sexually transmitted
infections (STIs) and other disorders can affect the vagina. Because of the
risk of STIs, safe sex practices are recommended."
mc clanahan,lally serving sass
üöÇüöÉüöÉüöÉüöÉüöÉ,"The vagina is a muscular and tubular part of the female
genital tract, which in humans extends from the vulva to the uterus. The outer
vaginal opening may be partly covered by a membrane called the hymen. At the
deep end, the cervix (neck of the uterus) bulges into the vagina. The vagina
allows for sexual intercourse and childbirth, and channels menstrual flow,
which occurs periodically as part of the menstrual cycle."

fuccboi,
Tuna,@Max Care I wanted to see your presentation but had too much hw. Can you give me and mark a private one?
mc clanahan,MUSTACHE ON THE BOTTOM
Mark,If it were all green hair it'd be cool
fuccboi,Fgh silhouette look really bad imo. It's not as distinct as other buildings

fuccboi,Option 4: none of these
fuccboi,
fuccboi,
fuccboi,
fuccboi,aight here are my design proposals for the quarter zip/hoodie/whatever we end up getting. Like whichever options you'd be willing to wear (multiple votes are ok). Danny and I won't be offended by your choices. I'm keeping this vote up until Thursday morning so that we can try to get an order together by Monday.
Tuna,Post pictures of your dogs and hashtag #solidaritywithmarley

Mark,"I know that would step into trademark issues but there might be an issue with ""vanderbilt"" as well "
Mark,Can we put the oak leaf on it
Mark,Also it should say isis supporters instead of vandy cs
GroupMe,Tuna changed the topic to: Hoodies or 1/4 Zip
Mark,Yeah but classy is sassy
Tuna,"Keep in mind. It'll be printed, not embroidered. Which may look better on the hoodie."
Tuna,Like this for hoodie!
Tuna,Like this for quarter zip!
fuccboi,Bonus of a hoodie is the ability to be in shell mode
Tuna,"s classy, but hoodie can do shell mode..."
Tuna,Ok. Jeff and I are looking into the CS stuff. We're gonna poll between quarter zip and lightweight hoodie (think microsoft hoodie). Quarter-zip'
mc clanahan,call him out
Taylor Beck,"A kid giving a presentation in my class just mentioned ""a hacker named 4chan"""

You can pitch a project that you're interested in and allow people to join you (I recommend limiting your group to 1-2 people).

You can pitch yourself and allow an underclassmen to join you, pitch an idea to you, and then help them with their project - provide input, code a little bit, make architectural decisions. 

We strongly encourage the second option for upperclassmen who want to be involved, but don't have any projects they're dying to work on (this is what I'm doing).

Also there will be free chipotle!"

mc clanahan,let's get fucked up at dan's (lab)
Professor Thotte,At first glance I definitely thought Dan was playing pong. 
mc clanahan,don't get me wrong it was very clever
eUNIX,"Hahah last 20 sec yo. When I saw Dans pic, my existential status became so clear"
mc clanahan,did you spend the last two minutes thinking of that
eUNIX,@mc clanahan I'm lost in the land of SML digging for enough Rubies to buy myself a tennis Racket to play with Dan. 
eUNIX,Funny how the above meme could apply to #dougschmidt

mc clanahan,it's easy to found a startup
Professor Thotte,Just talked to a co-founder of a startup. He's 18. 
Mark,Rand
Tuna,Oh
Tuna,
hoegrammer,
hoegrammer,"Yup, that's true! But there area ways to do that that are tactful and respectful, instead of straight-up belittling (which is what the few of my friends who *have* reported have dealt with)"
Tuna,This is  the last time John!
John Lally,Hi friends I lost the algorithms worksheet SOS
Mark,I wanna go to tribunal
I have a LISP,@hoegrammer I agree with that and would also like to add another layer of complexity - that they also have to consider the possibility that allegations are false. My understanding is that the debate is still current regarding fostering a culture of reporting but also validating the reports so that no one innocent gets screwed. 
Tuna,Does anyone know can I query a host centric MySQL db as not local host ?
hoegrammer,"the increase SA VUPD reports out to students is a combination of effects of national politics and the university trying to figure out how to handle out reporting and investigation. Vanderbilt's still under Title IX investigation for mishandling SA cases (along with more than 100 other colleges). The school is trying to institute a ""culture of reporting"" which gets really complicated when you consider how fuckin terribly the EAD handles investigations, how the university has an incentive to keep numbers low, how disciplined perpetrators are much more likely to sue than survivors who don't get justice, and how there isn't really a transparent way for survivors to seek after-the-fact resources without filing a report (for example, everyone at Project Safe is a mandated reporter)"
Mark,"Hide yo kids, hide yo wife"
A.L.A.N,For real tho.... I wonder if it's just a cascade of reports? Like one person reported theirs and other people realized they could/should follow suit kinda thing? 
I have a LISP,What's with all the sexual assault on campus lately? That's not chill
I have a LISP,Start up idea?
Mark,Danny that's brilliant!
mc clanahan,distribute computations over billions of human minds
mc clanahan,use the latino as a development platform

eUNIX,BRUUUUUCE !
mc clanahan,"he's wearing a shirt right now that says ""thank honeybees"""
mc clanahan,what an adorable human being
mc clanahan,@Eunice Jun bruce is super vegan he went on a rant today about it in class and everyone kept asking him questions cause they're all super conservative
GroupMe,Eunice Jun changed name to eUNIX

Ellis Brown,Yeah I think you can
Mitchell,does anyone know if I can live on campus as a part-time student?
mc clanahan,no but I'm writing ocaml so I might as well be
Mitchell,Danny are you still drunk
mc clanahan,mitchell my programming language dick is five times as big as yours
Mark,Yeah but Mitchell the thing about artificial intelligence is its not actually smart
Mitchell,AI uses Python all the time
Mitchell,"Scientific computing is mostly python, if it's not R or Matlab"
Mitchell,Whole industries like Python
Mark,"But Eugene likes python, danny"
Mitchell,Do not scorn the creators of Python
Mitchell,"Danny, language design is a complex and difficult thing"
mc clanahan,mark you can't just switch to js but it's one of the things python makes you deal with that really shouldn't be that hard
mc clanahan,damn right
Tuna,War is hell
Mark,Thanks for the find Mitchell!  Tuples are hell
Mark,You can't just switch to javascript
mc clanahan,or y'know you could just use javascript and return objects instead of tuples like we're still writing c
mc clanahan,I also read hacker news
Mitchell,Ive been looking for this https://python-programming.courses/pythonic/improving-your-code-readability-with-namedtuples/
mc clanahan,mine are just people asking if I'm colorblind

hoegrammer,all of my party stories are just hiding in people's rooms to avoid crowds and pulling people away from creeps
mc clanahan,ugh tell me more of your crazy party stories
hoegrammer,maybe? I think I left after. but I also spent a good chunk of time holed up in Megan's room ahahah 
John Lally,@hoegrammer  Did you leave before midnight? I was yelling for you but you were MIA 
hoegrammer,unless that was after I left for sparkman's
hoegrammer,@John Lally  where was I for this picture? also that party definitely had at least one japanese girl (me)

A.L.A.N,Get drunk 
A.L.A.N,Ok guys 
Garrett Hoffman,Wtf that would've been so helpful. I got an argument error and it just pointed to a line with 12 function calls. 
mc clanahan,no clue why that's not on by default
mc clanahan,and it gives you a stack trace for errors
mc clanahan,I think you just (require errortrace)
mc clanahan,there is a stacktracing library
mc clanahan,sorry eunice
mc clanahan,lol

Mitchell,"""I'm probably gonna run it once and pass all the tests"""

Eunice Jun,"I figured that out. But I wasn't sure how/where. the error was coming up in the code provided, so I tried back tracing mine to no avail."
mc clanahan,that means you're sending in a non-list to car
A.L.A.N,Fuck sobriety 
mc clanahan,oops
Eunice Jun,Does anyone get an eval-Exp car contract violation error?
mc clanahan,rt
John Lally,Sounds like a metaphor for Vanderbilt. You get spit out the other end smaller and in pieces 
mc clanahan,like that wood thresher outside of fgh today
mc clanahan,chewed me up and spit me out
A.L.A.N,Did Emma use you too? 
mc clanahan,I am an if statement
Emma Birdsong,I used an if statement in one
Eunice Jun,Part 3
Emma Birdsong,Are you talking about part 3 or part4?
Eunice Jun,"For 270 when we implement our functions, can we use non MUPL constructs? Such as if statements?"

Taylor Beck,Is anyone taking discrete structures right now?
Mark,I haven't had him but he's the best adviser ever
Mark,Biswas is doing an advanced ai course
mc clanahan,i guess if you're a grad student in ai
mc clanahan,"""original research"" is a bit much even for grad students"
mc clanahan,lmao
Mark,"About ai vs ml: n a nutshell: ML students will have a bit more homework material, will have to do a presentation, and will do individual projects (269 students will do team projects, in teams of 3). ¬†Also, ML projects will have to involve original research, whereas 269 projects do not have this requirement."
mc clanahan,project in ai is one big project you make yourself
Emma Birdsong,
Danny Carr,ok tuna
Tuna,Take it
Danny Carr,What's Computer Networks all about
‚ö™Ô∏è,"""I don't know long multiplication either"""
‚ö™Ô∏è,"""I am determined to graduate Vanderbilt with a math major without knowing how to do long division"" -- @Max Care "
Mark,I think there are lectutes
Matt Lee,"is project only a project or like ai 2 + proj?
"
mc clanahan,just the grad students get a lot more work
mc clanahan,I asked eugene
mc clanahan,like same lectures n shit
mc clanahan,they are the same course otherwise
mc clanahan,machine learning is harder than project in ai and isn't open to undergrads
Mark,just machine learning has no project?
Mark,wait so machine learning and project in ai are the same?
mc clanahan,true
Tuna,http://media4.giphy.com/media/Nz0rVQT4NPiBa/giphy.gif
mc clanahan,fight me tuna sandwich
Tuna,"First best, really. "
mc clanahan,second best dan on campus
Sam Carlson,Data Dan is the man. 
Tuna,Yeah I did. 
mc clanahan,like they ball hard
mc clanahan,both are sick motherfuckers
‚ö™Ô∏è,Did you take him for networks?
Tuna,Seriously 
Tuna,<3 janos 
‚ö™Ô∏è,Have any of y'all taken a class with Dan Fabbri or Janos Sallai?
mc clanahan,lifesaver
Tim Becker,You can get a free vandy fanny pack at the women's soccer game today
A.L.A.N,Y'all are famous now 
John Lally,We were at delt before the game that's all I know just embrace it 
hoegrammer,@John Lally john where did we even take that pic I don't remember at all
mc clanahan,the machines always win
mc clanahan,I can write a program better than that
A.L.A.N,Also did 5 shots in a minute
mc clanahan,I have a fanny packed with the strength of my gluteus maximus
A.L.A.N,I need a Fannie pack. Anyone have one? 
mc clanahan,that's typically frosh behavior
mc clanahan,they didn't look like freshman though which confused me
mc clanahan,just mouth to mouth
A.L.A.N,Do they not have dorms? Like wut? 
mc clanahan,lmao i just interrupted a couple tryna get romantic outside rand who thought that was a good idea
John Lally,Leave FGH and drink with me let's get silly 
mc clanahan,@John Lally  your life seems more fun than mine. wanna trade
John Lally,LOVER 
mc clanahan,LALLY
John Lally,God bless y'all 
Emma Birdsong,
Matt Lee,i didnt get cookies :/
mc clanahan,my favorite eunice memory is when she tempted me into her virtual reality fortress with cookies
mc clanahan,i guess i'll start
mc clanahan,now the party's really started
GroupMe,Emma Birdsong added Eunice Jun to the group.
mc clanahan,roth said his was recursive too though so
mc clanahan,I used tail calls though so on a debug build those may not have been optimized away
mc clanahan,SAME
Mitchell,I literally brute forced it
mc clanahan,I'm emailing the ta though lol
mc clanahan,can I see your code though I wanna know what he considers fast
mc clanahan,ok mitchell those are all pretty bad
A.L.A.N,#bodybags
Mitchell,Using goto's instead of function calls
Mitchell,Using dynamically allocated arrays when I could have used a static one
Mitchell,"Using a ""magic number"""
Mitchell,No just stupid shit
mc clanahan,did you get points off for efficiency
Mitchell,Yo imma complain this is bullshit
mc clanahan,SAME
Mitchell,I got like 15 points off for style things
Mitchell,Yeah what the actual fuck
mc clanahan,would have thought that'd clinch it
mc clanahan,yeah but i also used the visitor pattern to abstract and encapsulate access to the virtual destructor singleton
Sam Pepose,"You used mementos with an abstract strategy list, right?"
mc clanahan,like i'm sorry i didn't realize this was cs 251
mc clanahan,also he takes points off for style?
mc clanahan,let's talk about the cs 270 assignment where i got points off for efficiency when mine runs 10x faster than roths
mc clanahan,i'll start in a few hours maybe
mc clanahan,i haven't started idk
A.L.A.N,Cuz like cleaning each object is different so how do you make general schema 
A.L.A.N,I can't figure out what kind of actions to make 
mc clanahan,the programming part is just a* lol
mc clanahan,if you're like me then you'll need to look at the book
mc clanahan,if you paid attention in class to planning stuff the non-programming part is easy
mc clanahan,yeah
A.L.A.N,Anyone looked at hw4 yet? 
Mitchell,Woooo
A.L.A.N,No ai on Tuesday! 
mc clanahan,yeah he said it'd be dope
Matt Lee,"^ i didnt know we were allowed to leave fgh before midnight

also did vorobeychik say what ai proj was gonna be like?"
mc clanahan,spotted: graham hemingway leaving fgh at 11pm
mc clanahan,yeah 270 is fucked
Emma Birdsong,Unless he's on piazza I don't think I'm gonna find him 
Breakfast Team Captain,LET ME KNOW IF YOU FIND AARON CARTER TONIGHT
Taylor Beck,oh FUCK we had 270 due didn't we
Eric Rubio,Dream come true
Mitchell,fucking vectors
Mitchell,nvm
Mitchell,@Sam Pepose  @mc clanahan 
Mitchell,"yo, does anyone want to help me with programming languages"
Ellis Brown,Why is every professor besides Roth impossible to pay attention to 
mc clanahan,#relatable
A.L.A.N,And he hates American air 
A.L.A.N,Also he's apparently upset about some weapon parts nerf 
A.L.A.N,Might've just seen Otte drive away from kissam 
Bradley Faskowitz,"Yea, I took it."
DrRacket,Anyone got any info on what intro to database management systems is like?
GroupMe,Paul Gelston Murray added Nick Kline to the group.
Danny Carr,thanks ellis
Ellis Brown,Lil fyi 
mc clanahan,can confirm
mc clanahan,yep
Mark,I'm pretty sure graph theory is just marriage and orgy planning
mc clanahan,you'd probs wanna talk to him to see if that'll result in you getting fucked though
mc clanahan,idk like since it's mostly gonna be machine learning you could defs ask him to waive it
mc clanahan,oh lol you said that
I have a LISP,@mc clanahan Project has ai as a pre req
mc clanahan,a helpful ta??? never heard of that before
Mark,Our ta was helpful though. ..
Mark,They weren't too bad though 
Mitchell,Wait I thought we had quizzes in networks
A.L.A.N,Nice thanks
mc clanahan,nice
mc clanahan,!!!!!
Mark,@A.L.A.N no tests. Easy quizzes. Cool projects. And you get to choose your final project
mc clanahan,@I have a LISP  why can't you take project again?
mc clanahan,sallai is rad 4 sure
mc clanahan,nice ok i have an ee friend who's considering it
A.L.A.N,How not hard? Slash how much work? 
Mark,Networks with Sallai was not hard and he's the bomb and it was practical 
I have a LISP,Dang it I want to take project sooooo badly
mc clanahan,is networks hard
mc clanahan,"yeah vorobeychik said the lectures are the same course, but project in a i has a cool very open-ended project for half the course"
I have a LISP,FYI ai project and machine learning are the same course
Emma Birdsong,"Good thing he wasn't wearing neon today, that would've been too risky. "
Matt Lee,"just wanted to tell everyone that danny just left class, went to the pub, and walked back in 20 minutes later like nothing happened."
Sam Pepose,Ya but he made it up to us during comicbook story time
Mark,"Classic roth, always downing us"
mc clanahan,guys remember when roth told us all we had shitty work ethics and wouldn't survive in the real world
A.L.A.N,Shout out to Mitchell for anonymously quoting me on yik yak 
Mark,Nonlinear optimization is offered and it's the same professor. Mark ellingham is great
fuccboi,Damn otte is harsh
fuccboi,
‚ö™Ô∏è,Has anyone taken Intro to Mathematical Logic with Matthew Moore? Linear Optimization isn't offered next semester
mc clanahan,*if you want a good reason to kill yourself
mc clanahan,take 6311 from spinrad
Sam Pepose,Graph theory makes me cry and question our secession from Britain
Mark,Graph theory is not pretty easy.
Mark,Linear optimization is pretty easy
‚ö™Ô∏è,Anyone have suggestions on a good/easy math class?
mc clanahan,google xorg multiseat
Tuna,Two cursors would be pretty nice
Taylor Beck,sometimes I hook up two mice at once for maximum speed and control
fuccboi,Honestly the mouse is the future
mc clanahan,nice
I have a LISP,I'm looking into removing my keyboard entirely. It'll leave more room on my MacBook for the mouse.
I have a LISP,I just don't see why you need anything other than a mouse
Mitchell,I use spacemacs now
A.L.A.N,I mean have you used eclipse? Talk about gold standard for IDEs
I have a LISP,I heard its being discontinued because eclipse
A.L.A.N,"Emacs is a pretty crap program, I doubt anyone here uses it "
I have a LISP,If there's someone at our school you should lmk
I have a LISP,I don't know anyone who uses emacs
Tuna,Can someone do a pimp my emacs session tomorrow since there's no adv programming?
‚ö™Ô∏è,"If you're talking about the openstack stuff, its in powerpoint 4"
Tuna,where's the list of everything we need to install?
Tuna,ssh -i /path/to/key.pem ubuntu@floatingip
‚ö™Ô∏è,It was like 2 months ago that we did this. We have everything set up but are having trouble. It was something like ssh -something Ubuntu@ipaddress
Mark,Fuckin savage
A.L.A.N,(You need a floating IP) 
A.L.A.N,Pay attention in class? 
‚ö™Ô∏è,Anyone know how to ssh into the cloud vm for cloud computing?

mc clanahan,lol ml and ai are only nildly related
Mark,It's grad and yes I think so
Tuna,I emailed Eugene to ask if I could
I have a LISP,They're offering machine learning? Does that require ai as a prerequisite too?
I have a LISP,Ugh I should've taken ai this semester. Want to take project in ai so badly
mc clanahan,@I have a LISP  I'm taking project in ai and maybe ml?
mc clanahan,"sorry for not winking back at you @Sam Pepose , too busy thinking about wanting to sleep"
Mitchell,None
I have a LISP,What cs classes are people taking next semester
Tuna,FYI. I'm pretty sure the 3892 special topic taught by Daniel is Big Data and not also Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Sys De
Mark, 1 to 3
Mitchell,yo can someone tell me when schmidt's office hours are
mc clanahan,@DrRacket  getting pumped i see
GroupMe,Henry Bogardus changed name to DrRacket
mc clanahan,yours too
mc clanahan,*edgy
mc clanahan,thanks I'm going for edy tech asshole
Emma Birdsong,Your hair looks gr9
mc clanahan,feeling the otte vibes on fall break
I have a LISP,Haskell says I should go to the library instead of the bar.... Typical Haskell
mc clanahan,we could do some distributed ai shit
mc clanahan,join us
mc clanahan,you'd be good at it
mc clanahan,poss lol
Tuna,Think I could get into so projects without ai? I wanna and I'm a quick learner and whatever...
mc clanahan,red bulls are $2 a pack in illinois
mc clanahan,i'm so fucked up right now
Mitchell,^implying not already fucked up
mc clanahan,i'm taking literally all intense meche courses next sem and i'm gonna get fucked up
mc clanahan,haha rad
Mitchell,I just happened to get ensnared by it and found out it actually fulfilled the rec
Mitchell,Tru^
mc clanahan,i get that there's 282 but i refuse to entertain that monstrosity of an attempt at education
mc clanahan,"and yeah mitchell you're right but like there's no ""project in operating systems"" or ""project in compilers"" since compilers is MIA so ai is almost as cool"
mc clanahan,that's basically what i've heard
mc clanahan,@John Lally  thinking of taking it next sem so can finish up cs and focus on the 23 hours i have left to take for meche
Mitchell,Intro to computer graphics counts
Mitchell,CS 282 counts
Mitchell,Yeah not just the ones with project in the name
Mark,Computer networks counts
A.L.A.N,I had to do a paper. And that's it 
A.L.A.N,LOL get rekt 
Mitchell,Wait danny a lot of classes actually count for the project course
A.L.A.N,Wait john my computer ethics class was great. Like my professor just didn't give a fuck. Also a super cool guy like I'm going to eat at his house tonight and then go bar hopping together 
John Lally,6 presentations 6 papers 6 quizzes and a final project is too much for 100 level bs class 
Mark,If anything it made m e less ethical
John Lally,@mc clanahan Are you also in ethics because computers and ethics is officially the worst class I have taken at Vanderbilt I hate it more than anything 
mc clanahan,myers is the man tho
mc clanahan,also fuck cs ethics
mc clanahan,@Max Care  let's get turnt w/ eugene
mc clanahan,yeah i'm gonna do project in ai
Mark,Eugene is the man. You're going to do whatever you want regardless danny
mc clanahan,thinkin bout project in ai cause vorobeychik is baller but i've heard software engineering you can basically do whatever you want
mc clanahan,finna finish up my cs curric
mc clanahan,what's the move for project courses next sem
mc clanahan, oh shit thanks for reminding me
A.L.A.N,Yeah 
Mitchell,"Hey for AI, you only have to submit once per team, right?"
mc clanahan,groupme.p-mcg.com
A.L.A.N,What's the URL for the groupme analytics site again?
‚ö™Ô∏è,Sorry y'all I'm feeling nostalgic
GroupMe,‚ö™Ô∏è changed the group's avatar

mc clanahan,B)
mc clanahan,wait shit
mc clanahan,:B
Tuna,"Guys, Mitchell? So sick. "
mc clanahan,"one person fucks their own family, so it's even more recursive! "
mc clanahan,"for example, game of thrones draws a lot of inspiration from lisp"
‚ö™Ô∏è,That's some Jeffrey Dahmer shit
mc clanahan,and lisp still actually has effects today even if we don't use lisp itself
mc clanahan,you can actually fuck an entire family in a single function
mc clanahan,"so you fuck the head, then its parents, and so on"
Mark,Right
mc clanahan,"a list is like a flat tree, right"
mc clanahan,it's super cool actually cause it's all recursive
mc clanahan,this led of course to the free love movement of the 60s
mc clanahan,cause it's all ~homiconic~
mc clanahan,yeah and lisp was developed so you can fuck a function too
Mitchell,"wait, literally or figuratively"
mc clanahan,roth demonstrated on the board
mc clanahan,we learned how to fuck a list today
Mark,Mitchells sick guys ÔøΩ
Mitchell,both literally and figuratively
Mitchell,yo how was class i missed it cuz i'm sick
Garrett Hoffman,Lol immediate regret 
mc clanahan,big move @Garrett Hoffman  contradicting roth to his face

A.L.A.N,Eh that's what my butt plug is for 
mc clanahan,then shove it up your ass
A.L.A.N,Also it'd still vibrate all the time 
A.L.A.N,Yeah but I was waiting for an email
mc clanahan,i know you're a wriggler
mc clanahan,can't wriggle outta this one alan
mc clanahan,if you were trying to work then just mute your entire phone
A.L.A.N,I don't usually there was just spam when I was trying to work. And groupme doesn't have mute for an hour like Facebook 
mc clanahan,isis gang or die

Ellis Brown,"Anyone in OS, do we have a quiz??"
I have a LISP,Anyone want to see We Were Promise Jetpacks on December 2 at exit in?
Mark,"When he/she asks you out, even though a chill may run down your tundra and you can't stop your poops from slaughtering, just play it tubular. Take a long pause before answering in a very grubby voice. I'll have to defenestrate it over."

Each and every day, wear a thong that you know shows off your big toenail to sultry advantage and make your frog look like a million motherfuckers. Even if the two of you make meaningful cunt contact, don't admit it. No hugs or pugs. Just shake his/her dick firmly. And remember"
A.L.A.N,Frog
Mark,Ok an another noun?
A.L.A.N,Big toenail
Mark,Ok what about a body part
A.L.A.N,Butts
Mark,Guys I need a plural noun
AJ,hopefully no
AJ,Chapter 10

mc clanahan,idk
A.L.A.N,What is it? 
mc clanahan,probably
A.L.A.N,AI people is there assigned reading for tomorrow? 
A.L.A.N,I love his stories I think they help break up the constant focus and thinking with some fun

Mark,WHO CARES ABOUT TESTS WHEN LIFE IS ON THE LINE
‚ö™Ô∏è,"For a test you would really just have to draw it or say ""rightmost/last element"" Implementing one would be a bit different."
Mark,Do you keep track of where the rightmost leaf is
‚ö™Ô∏è,@Mark this is a pretty good visualization of adding something to a heap
Gross,I might have left my notebook in the 212 room/ VandyApps room and if someone is there and can check for me that would be amazing 
Gross,Is anyone in featheringill right now?
A.L.A.N,"Add bottom level, furthest left "
Mark,How do you ensure completeness of the binary tree?
A.L.A.N,Basically promote the child that keeps it a heap (parent bigger or smaller than kids) 
A.L.A.N,So that it stays a heap. If its a min heap then promote 7 
A.L.A.N,For a max heap 
A.L.A.N,Promote 8 
Mark,Say root is 20 and has left subtree starting at 8 and right subtree starting at 7
Mark,How do you choose which subtree to bubble down to?
‚ö™Ô∏è,"Heap sort you just pull off the root node, then move the last leaf up to the top and bubble it down. Repeat until it's empty"
‚ö™Ô∏è,"Heaps are just messy binary trees. A parent node is always less than the it's children. Heaps are also complete, so every node has two children, at least until the leaves, which can be incomplete if there aren't enough nodes "

Mitchell,"Besides, meth doesn't even kill you"
mc clanahan,not if I'm dead
Mark,Get in line bub
Mitchell,Wait you gotta take ai first

Mitchell,Rephrase 
Mitchell,What
A.L.A.N,"AI people: my friend who took the class said that
There's quite a bit of applying the algorithms and other stuff similar to that on the test "
mc clanahan,i just woke up and haven't started ai

Mitchell,AJ are you even in that class
GroupMe,AJ Ballway changed name to AJ
AJ Ballway,induction
Mitchell,wait how do i deal with time
Mitchell,thanks
Mitchell,yeah that sounds right
Mark,Well you convert the FOL to CNF and that keeps the variables but gets rid of quantifiers I think and then you substitute Marcus in for x when you need to
Mitchell,substitution?
‚ö™Ô∏è,^^
Mark,I converted them to first order logic and then did substitution and then did resolution
Mitchell,"Also for question 1 on AI, are we supposed to convert each sentence to propositional logic first and then do resolution?"
Ellis Brown,Does the proglang test on Wednesday cover section 3 of the videos?
Tuna,Looking at you
Tuna,@Gross 
Mark,I second that 
Tuna,Pls
Tuna,Can someone do a pimp my emacs night? I'd rather someone teach me than sift through the piles of documentation. 
‚ö™Ô∏è,Yep
Mitchell,Just up to propositional?
Mitchell,"Hey so AI doesn't cover first order logic, right?"
I have a LISP,Heck yeah VandyApps does and capital one is ordering us a bunch more

‚ö™Ô∏è,Recreate the North 5 stash in Jacobs Believed in Me so we can cry about how are parents never believed in us
Breakfast Team Captain,Taking a cue from commons' strategy?
Max Care,We could keep stashes above multiple tiles so if people are by one we can get at the other. 
mc clanahan,we're discussing ceiling tiles
Breakfast Team Captain,Glad to continue the tradition of getting drunk in fgh
Tuna,Yes! In 226 maybe

A.L.A.N,"So what I did was just read the notes, made sure I understood it all, and that was it. Not a ton else you can do. It worked pretty well "
John Lally,I study in the divinity library because one time during finals someone was walking around pouring whisky into everyone's coffee calling themselves the divinity fairy.

Tuna,That's my POA
mc clanahan,sobbing loudly
hoegrammer,y'all how does one go about studying for algorithms

Breakfast Team Captain,I think its just a drop through doreways. I didn't apply until after my first round because i met them at icd

Breakfast Team Captain,If you want more info talk to me/ethan
Breakfast Team Captain,Hey guys just an fyi that bny mellon is having an info session for tech people 5-6pm tomorrow! I know its not like a google/microsoft name but i worked there over the summer and learned so much more than i thought I would and they take interns really seriously
Mark,You don't have to be a participant 
Mark,"Hey if anyone wants to volunteer for a shift at vandyhacks, you can sign up here http://goo.gl/forms/nwXsEyh02Y"

A.L.A.N,I'm talking about hw2 
A.L.A.N,People in AI any idea how to do question 1? Like do we transform it into propositional logic somehow or what? 
Tuna,Right
Henry Bogardus,But there's no way he's asking if g' is a minimum spanning tree of g' right?
Mark,I was going to ask tomorrow what he meant by that
Mark,Wednesday
Max Care,Is that due tomorrow?
Henry Bogardus,"Hey people in algorithms, for number 2, does he mean ""will T necessarily be a min spanning tree for G'?"" Instead of ""will G' necessarily be a min spanning tree for G'?"""
A.L.A.N,YESSSS BUT ALSO NO 
Max Care,"I propose ""The Carol Swain School of Engineering"""
hoegrammer,you could do that with trap house
A.L.A.N,It'll be great 
A.L.A.N,Then we start a rumor with the freshman that its the place to get weed and we have lots of freshman wandering around looking for weed 
A.L.A.N,Building 420 
hoegrammer,"what about ""trap house"""
mc clanahan,I propose lord voldemort
Tuna,"Ok. Proposal, we should determine what we're going to call the new engineering building before they name it so we can spread it around and have everyone call it by the wrong name. I suggest ""Blayre"" just for added confusion. "
Tuna,We should make a commonapp for applying to internships.
GroupMe,Taylor Beck added Tucker Kirven to the group.

A.L.A.N,I didn't do the assignments
mc clanahan,that doesn't make sense

A.L.A.N,I never did 
mc clanahan,you have to make an assignments array
‚ö™Ô∏è,"Ai people, how do you assign a color to a node?"
mc clanahan,I interviewed for msoft in a sweatshirt
‚ö™Ô∏è,Probably not
A.L.A.N,Are software companies going to care if I'm in a sport coat ? 
‚ö™Ô∏è,"@Ellis Brown Depends on who you want to talk to. If you're going for companies that do primarily software (e.g. Microsoft, Epic, etc.) just wear khaki shorts or jeans and a decent shirt because the people you're talking to expect you to be wearing either that ot what Mitchell just said. If you're looking at companies that aren't software based, you pretty much need to wear a suit or sports coat"
Mitchell,"And one of those ""Make America Great Again"" snapbacks"
Mitchell,And a ripped t-shirt with mustard on it
Mitchell,Imma wear sweatpants
Tuna,CS isn't as big of a deal to wear a suit

Mitchell,So I've never told you guys this but I'm actually a sophomore. I tell people I'm only graduating a year and a half early so I don't seem pretentious. 
A.L.A.N,Me. I'm a freshman 
fuccboi,Are there any freshmen/sophomores in this group? Please tell me no.
hoegrammer,my friend like to have cinnawaffle nights https://v.groupme.com/13238999/2015-09-23T15:43:59Z/262a8c1a.224x128r90.mp4
hoegrammer,... downside?
Max Care,I need to get a waffle maker at some point. The downside though would be that I would then exclusively eat waffles. 
A.L.A.N,Use Otte's
hoegrammer,well ya done fucked then
Tuna,I dont have a waffle machine :(
Tuna,OMG!
hoegrammer,would recommend v delicious also incredibly easy

Breakfast Team Captain,I once got endorsed on linkedin for making coffee i mean yea i took it down but just saying i have the skills necessary
A.L.A.N,I'm just a failure at delicate üò≠üò≠
hoegrammer,can I advertise myself as a coffee-fetching intern? I make a mean latte
A.L.A.N,I did add vinegar 
Emma Birdsong,So the Google doodle is looking real sexual today
Breakfast Team Captain,Add a few drops of vinegar to the water
Tuna,Im with you alan
hoegrammer,hella aggressive. you need delicate womanly hands
A.L.A.N,Then I bought pots and it was all ok 
A.L.A.N,When I did it anyway 
A.L.A.N,It came apart in the water 
hoegrammer,then again I burn toast on the reg so that doesn't really mean much
hoegrammer,I burn toast way more frequently than I fuck up a poached egg
hoegrammer,on the real tho how do you fuck up a poached egg other than over/undercooking it or just cracking the yolk entirely
Tuna,cooking cinnamon rolls rn!!!
Tuna,:(
hoegrammer,just totally failed a coding interview but it's ok because I had a poached egg on toast for breakfast so I have that going for me
fuccboi,I would too
Tuna,i would
A.L.A.N,Do you wear it around campus tho ? 
Breakfast Team Captain,May or may not own a make america great again snapback in preparation for being a trump fan club member for halloween
A.L.A.N,"I know Danny's pretty dumb, but cmon, he's not that bad "
A.L.A.N,Nope 
I have a LISP,It wasn't Danny?

Breakfast Team Captain,Felt i should change my name since instead of convincing others to drop algorithms i just dropped it myself

mc clanahan,fuck
#dropalgorithms2k15,We have a magic bullet there could be smoothies
A.L.A.N,Like really I just got one for free 
A.L.A.N,Damn brutal but yes. I have a breakfast burrito maker!!!
mc clanahan,turner you have great ideas have I ever told you that
#dropalgorithms2k15,Like so into it
#dropalgorithms2k15,WAIT IM SO INTO THIS IDEA
Tuna,"We should get a portable Coleman grill and all cook breakfast in fgh one morning and when other people try to get some be like ""no fuck you"" because we won't share and the atrium will smell like bacon and be awesome. "
A.L.A.N,Make America great again. Like it was in the olden days. Name one thing that happened before the 60s that was bad. 
A.L.A.N,Thst
A.L.A.N,Yes
#dropalgorithms2k15,Make america great again
A.L.A.N,Orrrrr
Mark,Go to bed
mc clanahan,instead of arguing about silly things let's talk about politics
A.L.A.N,Hey I started talking first 
Tuna,"Alan gtfo, those are my eggs"
A.L.A.N,MAKE THEM FOR ++PARTY
Tuna,I will make the toast
A.L.A.N,Yeah what Turner said. 
A.L.A.N,(And then my idiot friend waltzes in and does it right the first time. Grrr. But I'm not bitter) 
Tuna,Poached?
#dropalgorithms2k15,üíÅüèº
Tuna,"Tiffany, will you make me eggs?"
A.L.A.N,Every time I've tried its ended up looking like puke 
A.L.A.N,No it was I'm surprised you are able to
#dropalgorithms2k15,Yea just get water close to boiling then turn off heat swirl water and gently drop a cracked egg in (helps if you crack in a bowl then ease it in) cover and let sit for 3 mins then take out (ideally w slotted spoon but regular spoon done with finesse also works)
mc clanahan,google it you liberal
A.L.A.N,No but really. You can poach eggs? 
A.L.A.N,Thanks Danny. 
mc clanahan,yeah they're trying to crack down on it but professional poachers still make a living off of it
A.L.A.N,Wait you can poach eggs? 
#dropalgorithms2k15,Wait yay someone sent shoutout to the human race üíóüíó
#dropalgorithms2k15,If anyone is in control systems and has the hw questions that are due tomorrow i would love you forever also repay you in cookies or greek yogurt or eggs (prepared any style! Even poached guys) or alcohol i think that covers everything humans like PLEASE help meeee
mc clanahan,sorted lists are communist
Tuna,"sortList = sorted(myList, key=lambda t:int(t[1]))"
Tuna,"If anyone's curious, the answer is this"
Tuna,"I tried 
sortList = map(lambda t:int(t[1]), myList)"
Tuna,"so question, if I had a list of tuples in python, the first containing a string and second containing a int that was read as a string, how could I typecast the int to an int so I can sort numerically?"

‚ö™Ô∏è,"if code.argueOver():

A.L.A.N,Eh that's arguable 
mc clanahan,more pythonic
mc clanahan,it's more explicit and readable
A.L.A.N,Also that code is bad. Literally just if you.ableToParty() works 
mc clanahan,python's a shit language
Gross,"If you.ableToParty() == true:

mc clanahan,literally fuck you guys
A.L.A.N,Lol I'm just saying. I'm not gonna say no 
Gross,Idk Alan

A.L.A.N,Isn't that the two+two=four one? 
A.L.A.N,No I don't think so? 
Mark,For number 1 in hw1 in AI is it OK to use resolution with first order logic?
Paul Gelston Murray,I DID IT FIRST!

A.L.A.N,I think it's usually Thursday 
Tuna,Is that today or thursday?
Matt Lee,wait i think theres a cloud quiz. didnt he mention something about knowing commands and what they do?
‚ö™Ô∏è,This was in the crime report Vandy emailed us
A.L.A.N,Thanks 
Tuna,I emailed him
A.L.A.N,No. Itd be great if he posted to oak but 
Tuna,did we ever decide if there was a cloud computing quiz?
mc clanahan,*fork
hoegrammer,jk HK is probably exempt
mc clanahan,isis supporters gettin edgy as FUCK
hoegrammer,didn't realize multiple children were allowed in China

mc clanahan,when people started adding everyone and their mother
üçÜ,When did this group get 43 members...?
A.L.A.N,Ummmmm maybe. That just dawned on me 
Tuna,Alan. Do we?
Mitchell,"It's ""Anal Computing"""
Mitchell,Turner you should really use proper terminology 
Tuna,‚òÅÔ∏è->üçë
A.L.A.N,Butt?

Max Care,"If somebody else helps organize it, I can probably host ++party in my towers suite. "
Mitchell,Hey have you guys heard of beautiful soup? I've heard it's pretty good.
Mark,@Tuna beautiful soup by the way
mc clanahan,cheerio is p good
mc clanahan,node js and an html parser
A.L.A.N,Ugly soup 
I have a LISP,Whoops
I have a LISP,Beautiful soup

Mitchell,Plz Come
Mitchell,https://www.facebook.com/events/1652919128289286/
GroupMe,Tuna added Brad Bark to the group.
Tuna, Exactly
Max Care,Just a couple of lines. But YMMV seeing as I got 60% on the last one. 
Tuna,How much did yall write for the first 2?
Tuna,Yeah. He said assume undirected in class unless specifically stated otherwise 
hoegrammer,it doesn't specify
hoegrammer,is it ok if it only applies to undirected graphs
mc clanahan,in other news I went outside for the first time today and immediately five bugs landed on my arm
mc clanahan,in order notation
mc clanahan,2m is <= m+n
Max Care,Or actually 2m+n. But same idea. 
Max Care,Yeah I got 2m as well. 
Tuna,I may just be thinking about it wrong
hoegrammer,oh I got 2m which is < (m + n) ..... I think 
Tuna,I think that'd be mn + n
hoegrammer,ok I think I'm just gonna make a new adj list out of it bc I don't know of any list sorting algorithms that are that fast
Max Care,"Sorry, that was late. "
Max Care,I think we have to start with an adjacency list. 
hoegrammer,ohh ok
Tuna,The graph is represented by an adjacency list
hoegrammer,do we have to start with an adjacency list and sort it? or can we create a new adjacency list just from the graph 
mc clanahan,"some problems he may allow you to assume a different structure, but he'll usually say that explicitly"
mc clanahan,"you can always make a different structure, but that does add to the time complexity"
John Lally,Shhhh stop working it's game day 
Tuna,"For 2 in algorithms, do we need to keep it as an adjacency list, or can we put it into a different structure?"
Emma Birdsong,20 minutes into coursera and chill and he gives you this look

mc clanahan,no
A.L.A.N,If I remember right that's correct

mc clanahan,beep boop
mc clanahan,I do not forget
hoegrammer,we mean 100
hoegrammer,we forgot danny's basically a computer
mc clanahan,yeah mitchell can you tone it down we're not all as fucking talented as you
Max Care,Yeah I can only count to 3
mc clanahan,what the fuck are 4s
Danny's Arch Nemesis,It's way easier if you make sure they're all 3's
Mitchell,That's how I did it ;D
Mitchell,"Alternatively, you can get your transcript and make sure all the CS classes have 4's next to them"
Tuna,sick thanks
Emma Birdsong,Degree audit 
mc clanahan,I actually don't know sorry
Tuna,no. I want an easier way
mc clanahan,you can use math I think

Ellis Brown,Which sections in ch 5 are covered
Emma Birdsong,"My personal fave was re:Fortran
""It is the language of the streets in the best sense of the word, not in the prostitutional sense of the word."""
Bradley Faskowitz,"Programming languages book: ""Well-known author Daniel McCraken"".  This has to be the most badass name I've ever heard."
mc clanahan,hw is easy as fuck
Bradley Faskowitz,Boooooooo Roth 
Emma Birdsong,Because we didn't cover them
Emma Birdsong,I think the quiz is over some stuff from 3 and 5 too? Anything on the reading list I believe is fair game except the last few sections of chapter 5
Bradley Faskowitz,"So a couple of questions: programming languages quiz is on chapters 1 and 2, correct?  I just realized there is a programming languages hw due tomorrow.  Is it difficult? (Haven't looked at it yet)"
hoegrammer,^would agree
Danny's Arch Nemesis,A&s has way better lecturers in my opinion
mc clanahan,this comes from Julie Adams so probs real
mc clanahan,engineering is apparently harder to get into than arts
hoegrammer,*hairflip*
hoegrammer,admit rate for A&S is p low
mc clanahan,cause I'm here
Matt Lee,why is vandy ranked so highly anyway? are we just being carried by peabody
Mitchell,We actually use their assignment shells and everything
Mitchell,Our AI class is a copy of Berkeleys. I discussed it with a friend who goes there
I have a LISP,Although berkeleys advanced cs intro course uses SICP so they got us there
I have a LISP,"To be fair, my intern friend this summer is at Wisconsin and we were comparing curriculums and were both shocked at how similar they were. He was jealous though that we didn't have 300 people in all our classes, and I was jealous he got to take his DB class with some crazy hot shot researcher (can't remember who)."
mc clanahan,yes quiz
Danny's Arch Nemesis,Who cares about job placement if our curriculum is still shit
Tuna,/is that confidential?
Tuna,Does 251 have a quiz on Thursday?
Ellis Brown,^thats also graduate level... I feel like our guys have been getting job placement indicative of a better undergrad cs department than #56...
I have a LISP,Yay
I have a LISP,Hell yeah we tied two of the worst UC schools

mc clanahan,fuck off brad
mc clanahan,give out quizzes. there's no key
Bradley Faskowitz,Do 251 TAs have their own groupme?  I don't want yo ping.
Tuna,Danny. Do I give out quizzes yet? Where's the key?
Max Care,"Yeah, I've been keeping it up to date"
Conor Joplin,Danny's question counter is off the charts
Tuna,Who's ddos'ing it?
I have a LISP,"^smash the stack, also a ctf"
I have a LISP,"http://smashthestack.org/
"
Mitchell,There's a bunch of CTF's going on all the time
Mitchell,Also check the HH: CTF group on FB
Mitchell,https://www.hackthissite.org/
Mitchell,http://overthewire.org/wargames/
Mitchell,"Also, there's a ton"
Mitchell,http://http://www.mcclanahanquestioncounter.xyz./
Mitchell,"Alright Mark, give it your best shot"
Bradley Faskowitz,Vanderbiltrejects.com
Mark,What's that site with a bunch of security challenges
Paparazzi Pepe,I am now on a mission to call him Otter whenever I see him.
Mark,But I'll try on the secure version too
Mark,Please don't. It was a good learning experience 
Garrett Hoffman,I've got $3 for whoever hacks Mitchell's secure website 
Mitchell,just to prove a point
Mitchell,but now I will
Mitchell,And I just didn't feel like it
Mitchell,"2. You can't just ""not leave the authentication in the source"". To fix it, I'd have to write a webhook for parse that validates save commands before saving them."
Mark,I don't know how to do it either 
Mitchell,1. I knew the site was vulnerable from the beginning. It's extremely obvious that you can just save whatever values you want from the console. I just didn't care.
Mark,Ok fine
Mitchell,"No Mark, you misunderstand"
#dropalgorithms2k15,"""I was out until 3am on Saturday night. Enjoy your twenties, I'm still paying for it"" -Julie Adams"
mc clanahan,and yeah mark but it's basically like to solve that you would have to do a lot more annoying stuff
mc clanahan,yo jeff I'm in fgh rn the vandyhacks posters look dope
Mark,Mitch your method isn't valid because we were able to screw with your site
GroupMe,Ellis Brown added Sam Carlson to the group.
mc clanahan,yeah jeff we'll have to think of a better one
mc clanahan,sorry I haven't done auth in a while with browser clients
Danny's Arch Nemesis,"Get mitched, McClanahan isn't as fun to say"
Mitchell,goodnight
Mitchell,thank you
mc clanahan,yeah that's actually right oops
Mitchell,MY METHOD IS VALID
Mitchell,I REFUSE TO BE SHAMED FOR THIS
Mitchell,"AND THEN IF YOU NEED TO DO ADDITIONAL VALIDATION, YOU WRITE A WEBHOOK ON THE PARSE SERVER SIDE"
Mitchell,YOU GIVE SPECIFIC PERMISSIONS TO EACH API CLIENT KEY
Mitchell,NO YOU'RE WRONG YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN API KEY TO ACCESS THE API
Mitchell,I'M LAZY THATS WHY I USE PARSE
mc clanahan,the js key is or should be strictly for testing
mc clanahan,that's why you do all api work on the server side lol
Mitchell,going to sleep
Mitchell,ok I'm tired enough that I'm getting into internet arguments
Mitchell,dumbass
Mitchell,So they can still do whatever they want
Mitchell,"even if you pass a hash to the server to get the token, the user still has access to the hash"
Mitchell,did you read the article?
Mitchell,"no danny, you're wrong about the hashes"
mc clanahan,no if you want to ensure security don't contract out
mc clanahan,about what your ddosable face or my immense js knowledge
A.L.A.N,Guyz we're leet haxors
Mitchell,About the hashes and shit
Mitchell,"Danny you are kidding, right?"
mc clanahan,you were asking for it
mc clanahan,you're so ddosable dude
Mitchell,Gratz
Mitchell,You got to 22 requests per second
mc clanahan,mcclanamanhandled
Mitchell,Parse just sent me an email
Mitchell,Also will you fuckers stop trying to DDOS me
Danny's Arch Nemesis,"GET MCCLANAHANNED, MITCH"
mc clanahan,use the token
mc clanahan,send the hash to your server to get the token
mc clanahan,no mitch actually you're wrong you gotta use salted hashes
Mitchell,https://parse.com/questions/javascript-sdk-security
Mitchell,just read this.
Mitchell,^ that's inherently wrong but I don't have the energy to explain it
Mark,Don't leave your authentication in the page source brah
Mitchell,I try to trust the internet for once and this is what I get
Mitchell,Ok Net Sec just cause it's vulnerable doesn't mean you have to hack it
Tuna,i brokeded your website
Tuna,http://www.mcclanahanquestioncounter.xyz lol
Emma Birdsong,It's a two part proof. You have to prove that it's greater than or equal to its lower bound then show a case where it's takes as long as its upper bound. Something like that I think?
Mitchell,Start small. Prove little theta
Tuna,How do you prove big theta?
A.L.A.N,Good. Glad you're not constipated
mc clanahan,"""we're shitting multiple times a day"""

mc clanahan,sounds fantastic mitch
Mitchell,"Update: as expected, quiz was fun"
Mitchell,"He like, sets up a Web server and we have to do like, capture the flag stuff"
Mitchell,It's an open browser quiz
Mitchell,But it's cool tho
Bradley Faskowitz,Nerd 
Mitchell,Sounds like fun
Mitchell,I'm actually pretty excited for the Web programming quiz tomorrow
mc clanahan,<33333333333333333
Emma Birdsong,I'll read to you ‚ù§Ô∏è
mc clanahan,I can't read
Emma Birdsong,Also @mc clanahan the slides say it'll mostly cover reading but could also cover lectures 
Emma Birdsong,Slides say Wednesday #blessed
mc clanahan,quiz on what
Bradley Faskowitz,Is the Programming languages quiz tomorrow or Wednesday?  Asking for a friend
GroupMe,#dropalgorithms2k15 added Ben Rivera to the group.
mc clanahan,fuck that
A.L.A.N,They're extra strict at the start of school 
A.L.A.N,Tbh I'd be super careful everywhere 
hoegrammer,which places are still good on fakes? I hear some places on demonbreun are now a lil unfriendly now
A.L.A.N,Drunk
hoegrammer,where is everyone
A.L.A.N,Yes there is a difference 
A.L.A.N,Drinking hole? Yes. Bar? No. 
I have a LISP,You haven't?
A.L.A.N,Towers is not a bar I've ever heard of 
I have a LISP,As are we
I have a LISP,People are moving to towers
Garrett Hoffman,Yeah it's kinda dead. And there's not really any booze 
I have a LISP,Most likely 
I have a LISP,Because we're going to bars
A.L.A.N,Why not? 
I have a LISP,Nah don't come
I have a LISP,It's not gonna last long though
A.L.A.N,There's never enough alcohol anywhere
hoegrammer,^thats the real question innit
I have a LISP,We've got a little more alc
Emma Birdsong,Is there enough alcohol there or nah?
Max Care,Asking the real questions. 
I have a LISP,And Adam knows you guys anyways
Sam Zeppos,ha and they say engineers have no social skills
I have a LISP,Definitely
I have a LISP,Yes it's big enough
A.L.A.N,Max's question is on point 
hoegrammer,also
hoegrammer,but is the club is full of ballas and they pockets full grown?
Max Care,Are there enough people that I can show up without knowing Adam that well?
A.L.A.N,Yes. Jumping. 
Emma Birdsong,"""Jumping"" lol"
A.L.A.N,Is the party jumping
I have a LISP,To kissam
I have a LISP,Text Aaron if you need to get in 7606134364
Garrett Hoffman,Come by Adams birthday party!! Warren 236 in Kissam 
Conor Joplin,üò¢
mc clanahan,it's ok alan we get it
A.L.A.N,I didn't want a solution I wanted to know what the assignment was lol 
mc clanahan,some people aren't fuckin code geniuses like you conor have a little patience
Conor Joplin,"The code from last semester is still in Gitlab. IIRC the first two assignments were pretty simple, so you shouldn't need a solution to help people"
A.L.A.N,I figured that I was wondering about like the assignment just in general 
Mitchell,*never have had solutions*
A.L.A.N,Oh shit right. Thanks Danny.
mc clanahan,the code for assignment one is on bitbucket. we don't have solutions if that's what you're asking
Garrett Hoffman,Pretty sure he didn't assign them the assignment yet anyway. 
A.L.A.N,"Hey 251 TAs, do any of you have like the assignments n such? Cuz I have office hours today and I will have like no idea how to help anyone "
mc clanahan,so my robotics class also has projects due friday at midnight and I'm feeling the burn now
Ellis Brown,^miseravle
Mitchell,This programming languages homework is making me actually want to die
I have a LISP,
Tuna,Blackout?
Max Care,A frozen cesspit. 
Gas Pedal,If he talked about quantum entanglement all the time he deserves to be there
Gas Pedal,That place is a cesspit
mc clanahan,he goes to cornell now thank god
mc clanahan,there was this one kid in my high school who talked about quantum entanglement constantly
A.L.A.N,That's not nice 
Mark,Hey fuck you
A.L.A.N,Marks new name is Carly 
Mark,Should I walk in and say you havent?
Gas Pedal,"Abhishek: ""Surely you've heard of quantum entanglement"" ...???"
Max Care,"I'd like to suggest that everyone in cloud computing install this chrome plugin:

mc clanahan,nice
Tuna,that was it! Im a genius
mc clanahan,"don't think they have one, I'd just remove the goog"
Tuna,what's vandy's dns server ip?
mc clanahan,that could be it
Tuna,*?
Tuna,dafuq. Im getting a DNS probe error? Do you think it's because Im using google dns servers>
Max Care,Yeah
Tuna,did you just type the url into chrome?
A.L.A.N,Ask him in class 
Max Care,Worked for me
Tuna,I used the url and got a webpage error
A.L.A.N,Haven't tried
Tuna,"Hey, can any of yall in cloud computing get onto the isis cloud? It won't work for me"
mc clanahan,unf
hoegrammer,@#dropalgorithms2k15 plz come I'm surrounded by Econ majors in suits
mc clanahan,FUCKING CALLED IT
mc clanahan,"""danny, would you mind grading this week's quiz?"""
mc clanahan,you should apply this to other areas of your life
#dropalgorithms2k15,W/e i dropped that class before  it even had the chance to drop me
hoegrammer,I don't think I know anyone else with strong opinions about KC & The Sunshine Band
Danny's Arch Nemesis,They're the best part of his class.
Tuna,It makes it less dry
Tuna,I kind of like spinrads  stories. 
Max Care,I'm glad we're able to learn all of these Elvis facts from algorithms. 
Gas Pedal,@hoegrammer you rock
hoegrammer,"was gonna tell @Gas Pedal  that I am good for 10/3, only in atlanta that sunday"
Tuna,I see you yoko
mc clanahan,literally told you
Tuna,Yeah. Come back @#dropalgorithms2k15

hoegrammer,BlackRock info session tomorrow 7PM in Wilson 126 who wants 2 go
Tuna,So much!!!!
A.L.A.N,What'd I miss? I had a meeting for work 
Tuna,I loved it. 
Gas Pedal,So many bro(grammer)s

A.L.A.N,Show 
A.L.A.N,I mean if otte hasn't annoucned when people are having them n o one will 
Tuna,Can I go ahead and hold office hours Danny?
Gas Pedal,I'll email you!
hoegrammer,do we have arduinos sitting around? or are we just using one
hoegrammer,it should! very slim chance I'll be going to Atlanta but I'll let you know in advance 4 sure
Gas Pedal,@hoegrammer fabulous!! Does that date work for you?
hoegrammer,I taught girls how to use arduinos this summer they're so fun
hoegrammer,@Gas Pedal YES
Tuna,"Not enough ""fuck""s"
Bradley Faskowitz,"""What do you mean you don't know what a semaphore is!?"" - enraged Danny at middle schoolers"
Tuna,You should get Danny. That way he can swear at them and scare them with his pink hair. 
Gas Pedal,Boys can help too but girls are especially awesome :)
Mark,Why are you trying to take the ladies away from vandyhacks
Gas Pedal,Ladies: Would any of you be free on October 3rd from 9:00-4:00 to help with an engineering day for middle school aged girls here at Vandy?  I have designed and will be running a computer/electrical engineering module that involves building a circuit and programming an Arduino and need a co-leader for the session. ¬†Let me know if you think you might could help!
A.L.A.N,I'll look after lunch 
A.L.A.N,Really? Last summer they sent me an email saying I couldn't forward it anymore and then disabled it. Like I tried to change it back and it didn't work 
mc clanahan,not for me?
A.L.A.N,They turned that off 
A.L.A.N,I can't 
mc clanahan,just forward it
A.L.A.N,Some student employees (me past 2 years) can't 
A.L.A.N,Like the vandy gmail 
mc clanahan,yes? 
A.L.A.N,Do TAs get to use gmail or nah?

mc clanahan,no it's not I had 10
A.L.A.N,That's a lot 
mc clanahan,but like since we have more now that's less important
mc clanahan,like 6 minimum I think
Garrett Hoffman,How many hours a week did you guys usually work last year? 
A.L.A.N,Idk when my office hours are though... 
Tuna,I just want to start so I can get paid. 
mc clanahan,I would recommend being at office hours though

mc clanahan,I'll text him
mc clanahan,he just applied I thought
Max Care,Do you guys know who Win talked to at Tesla?
GroupMe,"Std::cout added Jon Lee, Doug Lisk, and Taylor Beck to the group."
mc clanahan,he did that in the first day of class already literally I can't
mc clanahan,watch him respond at 11pm and give some bullshit excuse about his wife
mc clanahan,I just emailed him
William Otte,If you haven't heard by late tonight that's fair

William Otte,I have diff eq or I so would
mc clanahan,it's 5 grad students and me
mc clanahan,mwf
William Otte,On? 
mc clanahan,10
William Otte,When is it? 
mc clanahan,graph algorithms with my boy spinrad
William Otte,What's 6311? 
William Otte,I just forgot how to English 
William Otte,By error codes I meant error correcting codes/cryptography
mc clanahan,take 6311
mc clanahan,tf is error codes
William Otte,And I was considering that or error codes. But error codes is very morning. 
William Otte,I need another class 
mc clanahan,it's good for nerds like conor with nothing better to do with their lives
Max Care,I'm dropping it after going to the first class
Conor Joplin,Like threading and semenphores
Conor Joplin,It's android stuff/some OS concepts

William Otte,Read it to us Emma 
Emma Birdsong,
Tuna,Oh my god! Who cares?!
hoegrammer,there are like at least 10
hoegrammer,actually I am pleasantly surprised by the number of girls in here
hoegrammer,I think... there are not enough dudes in algorithms
Tuna,Just walked into theater history and the prof started playing run dmc music video. What is liberal arts
Tuna,I made it on the waitlist at least.
mc clanahan,I'm so jeal of everyone in web programming
hoegrammer,^ @Terrified of groupme pic you have hope!!!
Emma Birdsong,I would go anyway. Last year spinrad told the class on the first day that he was letting everyone off the wait list so like  miracles happen
Ellis Brown,It's still closed but I might just go to the class anyway today and see what's straight
Ellis Brown,Anyone know if web programming is gonna open any slots
mc clanahan,I tried to boot linux on my surface and it just yelled at me
Gas Pedal,it basically accosted my touchpad and it's just now recovering
mc clanahan,I've never really dealt with windows 10 as much as it just allowed me to believe I have some control over it
Gas Pedal,dealing w windows 10
mc clanahan,I'm programming what's your excuse
Gas Pedal,"Danny, I sense that this is just one of many days this year that we will find each other up at 2 in the morning"
mc clanahan,I'm CRYING
Gas Pedal,@William Otte @Mark in May if everything goes as planned
William Otte,Mark making the saves 
Mark,2hen are you graduating @Gas Pedal 
mc clanahan,tinder for uber drivers
Tuna,I'm not ahead with # of credits. Just cs classes. 
mc clanahan,fuk vandy I'm making a startup
William Otte,When????????
Gas Pedal,@William Otte yes really
William Otte,I'm with Mark. #vandyftw
Mark,But vandy is so fun
mc clanahan,@Mitchell is leaving next sem too
mc clanahan,most people do
William Otte,The really was to Rebecca 
mc clanahan,"cs has zero required courses you can join a frat, do masters, leave early, double major, whatever"
William Otte,Really? 
Mark,"I could too but am doing the masters. Not sure how I got so far ahead though, it's weird"
Gas Pedal,@Matt Lee I'm graduating early
Matt Lee,"7 APs though, but hopefully im not doing something gravely wrong lol"
Matt Lee,also are you guys fairly ahead in terms of CS scheduling? ive taken only 4 classes the past semester or two (granted theyre all core reqs) but im still pretty far ahead for graduating
William Otte,Oh yeah right they fucked jt all up 
Tuna,http://media1.giphy.com/media/RPVI1UkZwOkZq/giphy.gif
Conor Joplin,It's now Math 2810 for anyone looking
William Otte,216 I mean 
William Otte,Math 226 
William Otte,216 
Tuna,Can I be you?
Conor Joplin,What's the engineering statistics class?
Tuna,Hi Tiffany! I've been enjoying your shambly snapchats this summer!
William Otte,And still counts 
William Otte,Its way easier 
William Otte,Lol oh yeah 
Matt Lee,math statsss although can we take engineering stats for cs major? that sounds easier lol
GroupMe,Chris Lee changed name to Std::cout
William Otte,I retract my previous statement
William Otte,Oh valid 
Emma Birdsong,^didn't know which one he meant
William Otte,Wow so useful
Emma Birdsong,I think it's different than the engineering stats book

Conor Joplin,So it begins
GroupMe,Terrified of groupme pic added Chris Lee to the group.
Emma Birdsong,Okay I was curious! Thank you! üòä
I have a LISP,If you have any ideas about how we can do a better job of helping them or just want to talk vandyapps in general you can pm me!
I have a LISP,"We have not, primarily because we have non profits reach out to us fairly regularly and we already aren't able to help all of them (or even a some of them). Unfortunately right now we just don't have the capacity to actually build things that need finishing for people (if you know what I mean). We're actively working on the problem and are trying a few possible solutions this year."
Emma Birdsong,@VandyApps have you guys ever thought about reaching out to local non-profits to offer your services?
hoegrammer,I walked in and left
Tuna,fuggin sick
Emma Birdsong,Noooo I went to bed at like 11 haha. I'm glad I didn't go because that sounds like my nightmare
hoegrammer,it was more crowded than beta
hoegrammer,@Emma Birdsong were you at the party in will's suite yesterday? what the hell
Emma Birdsong,Teleport 
William Otte,How do we get to class then? 
Emma Birdsong,Everyone knows CS majors don't go outside duh

GroupMe,hoegrammer added Connor Lehr to the group.

mc clanahan,one day I hope to bypass linux altogether and just run emacs directly on the processor
mc clanahan,I use it as a window manager now
mc clanahan,use emacs
Mitchell,EZPZ
Mitchell,just learn windows shortcuts
Gas Pedal,I'll look into the drivers. I managed to make the arrow appear and move but I have no clicking capabilities
Emma Birdsong,"I checked for driver updates in the settings and it told me it was up to date, but I had to go online and actually look for driver updates to discover that they had a windows 10 update. "
Mark,Or press that function key that turns your touch pad on/off
Emma Birdsong,When I updated I couldn't scroll and it wound up being a driver issue
Mark,Borrow a mouse and reinstall the driver 
Gas Pedal,Please tell me this is a joke
I have a LISP,It's part of their ongoing effort to better involve age group minorities (primarily those 70+) in the engineering community by forcing them to use keybindings.
I have a LISP,"I believe they added vim key bindings.

""We believe that everyone should learn vim, because programming."" - Bill Gates, 2015"
I have a LISP,I hear they brought back the start menu but dropped mouse support completely so that makes sense
Gas Pedal,I am scooting around angrily using the keyboard
Gas Pedal,I just upgraded to Windows 10 and it made my mouse disappear wtf
mc clanahan,"also the guy next to me on the metro just used the term ""conversely"" unironically in conversation"
mc clanahan,what happened to #equality
Emma Birdsong,Why they gotta be girls though
I have a LISP,I crack myself up sometimes! (Just thought I'd let you all know)

Danny's Arch Nemesis,And otte and Schmidt!

I have a LISP,Small programs?
Terrified of groupme pic,Small mind small head?
Emma Birdsong,"You know what they say, small mind, small..."
mc clanahan,us small minded men are having trouble telling the difference
Emma Birdsong,Gonna start using <joke></joke>
Gas Pedal,Emma we are fostering a lot of confusion with our jokes
Emma Birdsong,(Sry I was kidding)
I have a LISP,She's always been super helpful to us
I have a LISP,No not that I know of.....
Emma Birdsong,But fyi Dr Johnson said nothing about VandyApps when I was talking to her so like yall beefin or nah?
Emma Birdsong,Lol bye üôà
Gas Pedal,I'm kidding -- VandyCS is a sore spot with some of the VandyAppers haha. But thank you for the informative response!
Emma Birdsong,No I don't think so. Though they don't have an anchor link page which makes me concerned about their registration. 
Gas Pedal,Is that the same thing as VandyApps?
Emma Birdsong,"The club, but I found it!"
Mitchell,"Btw, did you mean vandycs the club or the department"
Emma Birdsong,"But she doesn't quite understand touch screens. Idk if you've seen her snapchat video ""just chillin"" but she like aggressively taps the screen to switch cameras"
William Otte,Or at least the concept of email 
William Otte,Hillary sure does

Ellis Brown,"I've been checking periodically too, they should have made more spots üò†"
Tuna,Yeah. I'll do that
Emma Birdsong,"Yeah Hemingway said it was the grad one. Honestly, you could try emailing him. Especially if all the grad student spots aren't full. "
Tuna,"Theres a new one, but it looks like grad"
Tuna,no.
Emma Birdsong,Are you on the wait list?
Tuna,I wanna be in it :(
Tuna,Are any of yall in web programming?
I have a LISP,Turnt up turner Tuesday's

hoegrammer,@Terrified of groupme pic tutor me in neurobiology of behavior and you got a deal
Bradley Faskowitz,Yeah I'd really appreciate it if you dropped algorithms so Tiffany can take that class
Mark,Yeah drop it so tiffany can get in
Terrified of groupme pic,^drop algorithms so i can get in plz and thanks
hoegrammer,I'm not taking a programming class this semester fingers crossed I don't forget everything!!!
hoegrammer,oh weird it showed up green when I first searched it but now it's blue
Emma Birdsong,The wait list is full üò¢
William Otte,But I might be wrong 
William Otte,Last I checked it was full 
hoegrammer,oh shit. should I take that instead of comp org or algorithms....
Emma Birdsong,Lol jk
I have a LISP,"It's not new, but hemingway'll he way better than the last guy"
Emma Birdsong,"Yeah Prof Hemingway is teaching it, it's new this semester "
hoegrammer,theres a web dev class? I'm missing something here
Emma Birdsong,I am

Mark,Yes
Sam Zeppos,"html, css, jquery, redis, react"
Mitchell,Yo does anyone know what topics are going to be covered in Web Programming
Mark,Tiffany put the stuff on there ya fool
Emma Birdsong,^ they also give great portions for a bougie place
Terrified of groupme pic,Etch is delicious and one time a couple from chicago bought my dinner there 
William Otte,"I read that as kanye prime steaks and I was like ""Kanye owns a steak house? Damn!"" "
Emma Birdsong,Also saw Dean Wisclo at city house once 
Terrified of groupme pic,Kayne prime steaks
Emma Birdsong,RT^
Terrified of groupme pic,City house has like unreal pizza/pasta
Terrified of groupme pic,Also city fire $8 bottomless mimosas at brunch
Terrified of groupme pic,So i cant edit on my phone but theres a really cool speakeasy above the italian place on belcourt i think its called like savarino cucina or something italian like that lol
hoegrammer,also tin cup coffee in downtown shares space with a web dev company so their seating area is like tech incubator-like with giant tables and monitors and shit someone geek out and get coffee w/ me
Emma Birdsong,Love acme! It's cool that you can get the experience you want based on which floor you choose
hoegrammer,acme isn't really a bar but I want to get drunk there every night forever
Emma Birdsong,Love yourself üôèüèΩ
hoegrammer,how about tequila cowboy
hoegrammer,tin?
Emma Birdsong,Also I added a bar page! But if someone puts Dan's on there...üòí
Emma Birdsong,Yeah it is! And their fries üòç
hoegrammer,they have a japanese fried chicken sandwich!! it is pretty good ngl
mc clanahan,*sniffs* beautiful
Emma Birdsong,I liked that I could get a sushi roll with fried chicken in it. That's my idea of America. 
mc clanahan,god damn it I was literally planning to go there
Emma Birdsong,It was replaced by lucky belly
mc clanahan,is zumi dead
Emma Birdsong,"Yeah they did (RIP zumi), they had various bowls that were hit or miss"
hoegrammer,ya I took rani to sonobana and he asked me where the pad thai was on the menu... apparently zumi serves pad thai.
Emma Birdsong,"I've heard good things! Also, in case anyone had a dangerous curiosity like me, sushi train is disgusting. Zon't zo it. "
hoegrammer,"but @Emma Birdsong  you should check out Sonobana. it's decent quality, in the same complex as target"
hoegrammer,"literally who ate a salmon roll and was like ""i would really like strawberry and kiwi sauces on this"" (lookin at you, lucky belly)"
hoegrammer,fuck your samurai roll
hoegrammer,what is a dragon roll
hoegrammer,but like how am i supposed to take food seriously if it's named after mythical creatures or weird archaic japanese memorabilia
Max Care,"But not really, because nowhere sells good tuna."
Max Care,I make the best sushi in nashville.
Emma Birdsong,Lol well some of us have never been to SF so we have to take what we can get ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 
hoegrammer,people like to ask me about sushi places and all the places they mention are overpriced asian-fusion spots where they like drizzle weird sauces over rolls and shit
Max Care,In case you were planning on eating there.
Max Care,"One time I was in PF changs, and a pipe exploded in the ceiling, raining brownish water into the kitchen."
hoegrammer,$10 that beef is maybe a 2 on the Satay scale. maaaybe.
Danny's Arch Nemesis,"But we have pf Chang's with menu items such as ""beef a la sichuan"""
hoegrammer,"I love nashville but their asian food selection is actually abysmal. like, what major city has absolutely zero decent chinese food??"
hoegrammer,"hahaha probably. like, TTJ has three varieties of ramen and two of them just seem really bizarre to me (like paitan broth is supposed to be opaque and creamy? but the chicken paitan just looks like chicken noodle soup?)"
Emma Birdsong,I think how you feel about ramen in Nashville is how I feel about places like Loveless and the Row. It's southern-ish but it's not real southern food 
hoegrammer,"eh I would say the ramen at TTJ is like. pretty ok. then again most of my ramen experience has been in the bay area, and like, Japan."
Emma Birdsong,It's the quality of ingredients. The ramen I had in LA was cheaper but it didn't taste nearly as fresh and the broth was like..questionable. 
hoegrammer,two ten jack and otaku charge literally twice what I expect to pay for ramen
hoegrammer,looooooooool
Emma Birdsong,"Heads up, totally saw Otte at Two Ten Jack once üôà"
Emma Birdsong,^ loving all of this
Mark,Holy smokes
hoegrammer,hope yall can benefit off of my fiscal irresponsibility & coffee addiction
hoegrammer,added 20 coffee places. I have a problem
Tuna,add whatever!
Tuna,Yes.
hoegrammer,sweg
Max Care,I would use the coffee list. 
Mark,Yah player
hoegrammer,should I add coffee places?
Tuna,"It was originally for personal use and, therefore, not well thought out. But I think as long as it's by rating, it's good."
hoegrammer,"would recommend separating into sheets for casual, formal, coffee, bars, etc. but otherwise it's cool! i'm def using this"
hoegrammer,this is cool!!
Tuna,add them
William Otte,Or commons 
William Otte,Is rand on there 
Tuna,"Even if you haven't visited them, add them!"
Tuna,"Like fureal! Share with friends, etc. Try not to delete it alL!"
Tuna,Hey. a while back I made a spreadsheet of restaurants I wanted to hit up in Nashville. Feel free to reference and add to it (even if it's a local fave). I want to be able to link it to anyone whether a local or out of towner and have them use it! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r48CIV1eGAeen0iao-NPYLnwRVXIJSTUv24IQrgpnCs/edit?usp=sharing

Danny's Arch Nemesis,We jousted.

Danny's Arch Nemesis,You tryna start a fight?
Sam Zeppos,"The description says ""disconnecting graphs. Hamilton paths and cycles. TSP. Coloring graphs."" thats all old stuff jefe"
Danny's Arch Nemesis,It's veeerrry different. Make sure you take it with Ellingham if you do
William Otte,I wanna take cryptography at some point 
Sam Zeppos,The description seems to be everything we covered in 212/250 with spinrad for graph theory :(
Emma Birdsong,I'm in cryptography too~*
Danny's Arch Nemesis,GRAPH THEORY
Sam Zeppos,"The interpolation seems interesting, but the rest seems like BS. But I don't see any better math courses. I still need 3 for a major. 1 will be cryptography so I need 2 more"

hoegrammer,it is 81 in Cupertino and 66 in SF rn
hoegrammer,also SF weather is very different from Bay Area weather FYI because San Francisco is consistently 10-15 degrees cooler tgan the rest of the bay
hoegrammer,just visited @Danny's Arch Nemesis @ fb and debated this for like an hour
Bradley Faskowitz,Seattle is a great place to live.  I've visited many times since we've moved.  It's just the weather is terrible and would not recommend for someone whose mood corresponds to the weather.
Mark,So I'm in CO Springs and it's practically a desert here except this summer where it rains literally every day. So who knows?
Max Care,"Yeah. It was clear skies all the time I was there, but I've heard that its pretty much cloudy 24/7 the rest of the year. "
I have a LISP,I was pointing out that most of vandy has only been there for internships during the.... Summer
mc clanahan,oh yeah I was just saying as a general thing
I have a LISP,Well I think I was agreeing with brad bc he said they moved since it was dreary
mc clanahan,yeah cause fuck brad
I have a LISP,I guess I've heard that it's more the cloudiness than the rain that's annoying
I have a LISP,Dry/not always cloudy
I have a LISP,Has anyone besides brad lived there when it's not summer? My understanding was that summer was the only dry time
Danny's Arch Nemesis,"Well its like a drizzle for a couple hours a day, it doesn't ever pour. Don't even need an umbrella most of the time"
mc clanahan,probably a weird weather thing
mc clanahan,well it's defs cloudy but it rained maybe three times while I was there lol
Bradley Faskowitz,Source:  lived in Seattle for 2 years and we had to move because it was always so dreary 
Bradley Faskowitz,The thing about the rain in Seattle is definitely not true.  It rains longer and harder than Kobe in the 2006 playoffs.

I have a LISP,True true. I guess what I was saying is that in the Bay Area if you switch jobs you don't have to move all your crap to another state and most of your friends can remain the same. 
Sam Zeppos,"You can always move after a few years if you don't like it. Early in your career, I feel like the bay area is the way to go. Especially for connections and jobs. And some companies let you transfer offices. Like you can transfer to Seattle after a couple years in MPK."
I have a LISP,"Another benefit of the valley is that when you switch jobs, as you inevitably will, you might not even have to move, especially because almost every tech company has a presence there, big and small."
I have a LISP,Any big companies you go to in Seattle aren't going to have as diverse/interesting of projects to work on.
Sam Zeppos,Tldr: almost all of the cool stuff is in MPK
Danny's Arch Nemesis,"Also Facebook specific things to consider: Facebook Seattle is in the city, and Menlo park is like an hour from SF, so if you want to live in the city, your commute will be much longer in mpk.

Most product's core teams are in mpk. Seattle has a lot of infrastructure, ads, and less product focused teams. 

Dinner is a lot better in mpk, so you're more likely to eat all 3 meals at mpk every day, whereas that's less likely in Seattle."
William Otte,That's what stealing is for. Just steal a car 
Danny's Arch Nemesis,Oh wait you're applying for full time.
Danny's Arch Nemesis,"Also more diverse in general. Like 70% of people you meet here are in tech and it's overwhelming. Also since it's for an internship, Seattle has better public transportation imo which is huge when you don't have a car."
mc clanahan,yeah california condor is right
Conor Joplin,"Seattle is better IMO. Reasons:

 1. Seattle has a more diverse natural environment surrounding it. The mountains and lakes are beautiful, and it would take you quite a drive to find something comparable outside of SF

2. The cost of living is way lower. Both are high, but your dollar will go a lot further in Seattle than SF

3. There are way fewer homeless people peeing on the walls in Seattle. SF just smells like piss man. And shit. Someone shit on the Bart while I was in SF.

4. Seattle is right next to Canada/Vancouver. That's a plus for me.

5. The weather in Seattle is nicer than SF. It only really rains during the winter, and the summers will paradoxically be warmer than SF.

Either place is good, but if you can go to Seattle, definitely do that."
Danny's Arch Nemesis,Seattle all day
mc clanahan,you fuck
mc clanahan,quora is shit
Mitchell,Relevant http://www.quora.com/Which-Facebook-office-is-best-for-interns-Menlo-Park-or-Seattle

I have a LISP,Actually it is abc I was wrong
I have a LISP,Err nbc
I have a LISP,It's not going away. Just like ESPN or Disney or abc names didn't go away even though they're all Disney holdings
Phillip Hawkins,interesting move tho cause the google name is what people recognize
I have a LISP,Should also keep riskier arms from damaging the stock price of Google proper
I have a LISP,"For example Disney, with ESPN, parks, networking (nbc Disney channel etc)"
I have a LISP,It's really just what every other company does
Danny's Arch Nemesis,Google is splitting and calling itself alphabet what is going on
I have a LISP,My understanding was that the title of TA is reserved for grad students and that all undergrads are considered graders. Is that incorrect?
Danny's Arch Nemesis,Wow the sass
Sam Zeppos,He totally ignored it.

William Otte,"To be fair, underage drinking is very bad and should never be practiced, and those that do drink underage deserve the severest punishments available"
Conor Joplin,Context: Rosie ripped into Donald for not taking the Miss America award away from the '06 winner when she was caught drinking underage (20). That's why they hate each other so much

hoegrammer,(pretty is a social construction and everything is a lie)
hoegrammer,
Mark,Does it mean gender stereotypes are gone or are sexes gone too because girls are pretty and I'd like to keep them around
Gas Pedal,"I'm all about the equal rights, but idk how I feel about a ""post gender"" society tbh"
hoegrammer,"not that I really have a say, seeing as I'm ~* hella cis/het *~"
hoegrammer,but some say that it allows people who aren't ready to come out to be involved in the movement so idk
hoegrammer,"like, no one is concerned about ally rights"
hoegrammer,I always thought it was weird that they often include Ally in the acronym
Max Care,Gotta be LGBTTQQIAAP friendly
hoegrammer,~* post-gender *~
I have a LISP,More like neutered 
Mark,Why can't we all just be neuter

I have a LISP,Shouldn't the friend be taking the class?
Danny McClanahan,Wait how does that mean that
Mark,"An intern's friend is getting paid to take an online math class for a rich kid, which means all of us interns are taking an online class for a rich kid."

Danny McClanahan,no i just finished season 1
Danny's Arch Nemesis,The leaked episodes?
Danny McClanahan,this is blowing my mind
Danny McClanahan,holy shit do you guys watch rick and morty
I have a LISP,Haha cool
mc clanahan,c++ aka my main homie
I have a LISP,What is the v8 runtime written in?
I have a LISP,That's sweet though haha
I have a LISP,Ohhh I got u
mc clanahan,but lol don't count on it
mc clanahan,I'm playing with v8 and in gonna try to make progress on it this weekend
I have a LISP,Right that's what I thought
mc clanahan,this doesn't exist yet
mc clanahan,no coffeescript is just syntax
Danny's Arch Nemesis,Pls guys
I have a LISP,So did you say this is built into coffee script?
mc clanahan,yeah that's why I want continuations to turn async code sync
I have a LISP,Haha
mc clanahan,oh lol yeah
mc clanahan,literally it's five lines of code and they just memcpy the stack it's hilarious
I have a LISP,So the async call in order to make the constructor was hidden
mc clanahan,yeah dude I wanted to see hiw they were implemented so I looked up the guile scheme interpreter
I have a LISP,I was more trying to think of a way to encapsulate the factory inside a monad
mc clanahan,I mean the monad would be used in the factory function if I get what you're saying
I have a LISP,Hmm that's interesting. I'll have to read up on continuations some more
I have a LISP,Nm I was ignoring the constructor issue again
mc clanahan,*of
I have a LISP,"I don't know enough about monads to know for sure, but I imagine the ""return"" call would construct the object using an async call, not sure what bind would do... Maybe the same as a promise?"
mc clanahan,"yeah, promises make playing with a bunch if different async shit super easy so yes"
I have a LISP,Interesting. Would it be possible to make a builder monad that did that same thing?
I have a LISP,Okay yeah you just said what I was gonna say do I stopped haha
I have a LISP,Right so you basically end up with static methods that Bulls
mc clanahan,etc etc
mc clanahan,so you have to make a factory
mc clanahan,"yes, especially since some functions like constructors (!!) literally cannot have any async code at all"
I have a LISP,Creating object from async op
I have a LISP,Err how fundamental that series of operations is
I have a LISP,So it's obviously possible to do with callbacks (or syntactic sugar over callbacks a la monads) but it's inelegant given how fundamental it is?
I have a LISP,Ohhh interesting
mc clanahan,and there are other cool things you can do too but that's the most exciting
GroupMe,I have a LISP changed the group's name to Monads and gonads
mc clanahan,"if this was plain js, you'd be stuck with large callback chains in the code that called the constructor. with continuations, you can literally just turn that synchronous"
mc clanahan,"however, constructors fire synchronously"
mc clanahan,"you wish to construct an object, but it requires data that has only an async api"
mc clanahan,"your code is javascript, so it has some async bits"
mc clanahan,ok so imagine your code
mc clanahan,"I agree with the position, but when I say runtime support I mean it's a pretty fundamental feature that's not possible to do in plain js"
I have a LISP,What are the advantages to having runtime support over just using monads?
I have a LISP,Hmm. I feel like I would prefer a smaller language core a la lisp or JavaScript and then using monads to add that support 
mc clanahan,I'm halfway to hacking it into v8 rn actually
mc clanahan,eich brought it up as a possibility for es8 but it's unlikely
I have a LISP,"Like they aren't monads, but rather something built in?"
mc clanahan,"no, continuations require runtime support"
I have a LISP,"I haven't used coffee script enough to know, but are continuations a part of the language? "
mc clanahan,2) what they're trying to emulate is continuations which are actually fucking useful
mc clanahan,1) if you used coffeescript you wouldn't have this problem
mc clanahan,"promises are fucking stupid, they're syntactic sugar because people don't like the way callback chains look"
I have a LISP,Like for instance I found out recently that JavaScript promises are just monads. And then it all made more sense...
I have a LISP,"Yeah I just want it to basically be an exposure kind of thing. Not making anyone pros in anything (or just learning Haskell to learn Haskell), but learning some concepts that are applicable everywhere"
I have a LISP,Ugh coffee script is gross
mc clanahan,no those seem cool cause then people like me will actually look at the haskell docs without screaming
mc clanahan,except I tried using vanilla js recently and I hated it coffeescript is so much nicer lol
I have a LISP,But I'm open to ideas if you have some!!!
I have a LISP,"Basically I'd like to cover currying, first class functions, map reduce filter, then monads and transforming monads, then some type theory stuff"
mc clanahan,rad
I have a LISP,And then transition into Haskell after a few weeks and important topics have been covered
I have a LISP,Yeah I might just do straight up JavaScript
mc clanahan,you gotta free your mind
mc clanahan,why the fuck was there only types on there you motherfucker
mc clanahan,I love lisp
hoegrammer,yeah and I know a lot of people whose health insurance only covers medical care within CA unless it's an emergency so they use student health insurance
Max Care,"Hey, it exists for a reason. Because its charged by default it's covered by financial aid, and is the only health insurance I have. "
hoegrammer,also you can see prior submitted forms so if you've waived before and are still on the same insurance you can just copy paste everything 
hoegrammer,it's the first link
hoegrammer,just google Gallagher Koster Vanderbilt
I have a LISP,Bleh fvandy
Bradley Faskowitz,The deadline is actually August 1st but get on it.  It may be $1500 you don't have to pay.
William Otte,Yeah can you drop it here? 
I have a LISP,Can you send it to me brad?
Bradley Faskowitz,"If you have other health insurance, you can get that fee rescinded if you apply for a fee waiver.  I think it is due on the 15th.  I can send anyone the link who needs it."
William Otte,I mean would you know what Kleenex if it weren't for them? 
Emma Birdsong,Mucinex ain't cheap
Gas Pedal,Like wtf. All the student health center ever does is send you home with a Kleenex.
Gas Pedal,Did you guys know that student health insurance went up $500 from our freshman year to our sophomore year?
William Otte,I know I'm in Morgan or Lewis. Just not which one 
William Otte,I'd take building tbh 
Gas Pedal,Doesn't have a room number though
William Otte,Thanks 
William Otte,Oh yeahhhhhh I'll look. 
Gas Pedal,meals.vanderbilt.edu
Gas Pedal,It was through your meal plan
Emma Birdsong,I just remember there was a way before freshman year that everyone was able to find their housing assignments before they were officially sent out and I think it was on some bill somewhere 
William Otte,I looked around in YES 
Emma Birdsong,I think there might be a way to check in billing somehow. 
William Otte,I did. Sadly it hasn't 
Gas Pedal,Check people finder and see if it's been updated yet
I have a LISP,Ha yeah you would never like lisp haha
Danny's Arch Nemesis,Definitely Danny. I would never say any of that.
Danny McClanahan,hack the database
William Otte,Cuz like I can't remember. 
William Otte,"Unrelated topic, does anyone know how to find your room number for next year? "
I have a LISP,Haha I laughed so hard when I saw that response 
I have a LISP,Or maybe @Danny's Arch Nemesis 
I have a LISP,"Was this you on the vandyapps survey @mc clanahan ? ""i wanted to check the lisp box, but I wanted to say f*** your types JavaScript is the shit"""
Danny McClanahan,jesus that was a joke emma everyone needs to lighten the fuck up

Emma Birdsong,"Lol what you said was problematic, him pointing it out doesn't count as bullying "
Danny McClanahan,Oh yeah danny way to bully me on facebook
mc clanahan,like i said the dude was a fuckin legend
Bradley Faskowitz,The one that died in 1952?  The one that was reincarnated in 2005 for the sole purpose of completing the double ssh?  That Ronnie Jacobs?
mc clanahan,"the dead one, duh"
Bradley Faskowitz,Which one?
mc clanahan,the free breakfast at my hotel is a ton better if you get to it earlier
mc clanahan,"implying I was ""down"""
mc clanahan,"""up"""
Bradley Faskowitz,Why the hell are you up so early.  Don't you usually get to work around 11 or 12 lol.
mc clanahan,and he's dead now so I guess you're number one
mc clanahan,that shit's legendary dude the only other guy I've ever heard of doing it was ronnie jacobs in 05
mc clanahan,dude you pulled a double ssh??? did you get it on camera?
Bradley Faskowitz,This probably happens all the time but I just did a double ssh and I feel really great about myself because of it.
Emma Birdsong,OMG is that Guy Fieri's couch?!

Phillip Hawkins,you can thank me personally for that @Mark 
Danny McClanahan,because everyone has to live within 45 minutes of campus
mc clanahan,that sounds archaic
Mark,Gross
Danny McClanahan,We use real life here at Epic
mc clanahan,please I break out the winky faces on day 1
Mark,We use SameTime by IBM. My picture has my snake in it
mc clanahan,nobody known what it means but it's provocative
Gas Pedal,You know it's real when they start using the extra-smiley emojis
Gas Pedal,It's literally just like that
mc clanahan,fuck you dude it's a metaphor
Max Care,I actually have no idea what that would mean. 
Phillip Hawkins,"we can share screens, if you know what I mean"
mc clanahan,lemme hit u up
mc clanahan,gurl can I have yo lync id
Max Care,That's how my division works here. 
Gas Pedal,"Whenever I meet boys at intern events, they look me up and chat me afterwards on MS Lync"
Gas Pedal,"It's very 90s / ""You've Got Mail""-like"

Mark,I have like a hundred webcams so...
mc clanahan,I killed a spider with one yesterday
mc clanahan,they gave me like three
Max Care,I'm sure the palm pixie has an amazing webcam
mc clanahan,then how the fuck are you gonna use skype for business lol
Gas Pedal,We don't have any webcams :o
Mark,Holy shit webcams have xray vision?!
mc clanahan,don't worry I'll just turn on your webcam remotely and spy on your inner workings
Gas Pedal,I would take a picture of the email but no cameras allowed here
Gas Pedal,"Yo danny, we're getting skype for business here at Lockheed Martin. You better have done me right on this one."
Phillip Hawkins,motion to table all discussion of afterbirths
mc clanahan,I was comparing it to the fleshy afterbirth that is spam in a can
mc clanahan,I did lol
Max Care,Warmer??? Didn't you cook the spam???
mc clanahan,no it's warmer and softer
Conor Joplin,Tbh ingested spam is probably about the same as non-ingested spam
Conor Joplin,Yes. Or a can
Phillip Hawkins,"negative, spam ranger"
mc clanahan,do you really wanna see what spam looks like after it's been ingested
Conor Joplin,Pics or it didn't happen @mc clanahan 
hoegrammer,someone plz endorse danny for eating spam
mc clanahan,coast is clear. I'm taking the shot.
Phillip Hawkins,go for 2
mc clanahan,"can down. I repeat, can down. over."
hoegrammer,it's cool Tiffany and I will go to Pressed Juicery together 
Phillip Hawkins,being an adult is overrated
Max Care,"Pft, more spam for the rest of us. "
hoegrammer,I don't think I could manage 3/4 of a can of spam even if I actually really tried
hoegrammer,rather impressive actually 
hoegrammer,"Seems like you've got this ""adult"" thing down pat"
mc clanahan,I'm also eating hawaiian sweet rolls so hopefully that will pad ou t the other 25%
mc clanahan,well tonight I'm hoping to set a personal record

mc clanahan,ooh I've been endorsed for drinking coffee
Terrified of groupme pic,"I have had a friend endorse me for ""making coffee"" before"
Terrified of groupme pic,Lol 
Mark,But office is my top endorsed skill. I can't get rid of it now!
Conor Joplin,"Having Microsoft Office as a skill on LinkedIn is basically saying ""Hi I have no real skills, so I'm going to put Microsoft Office and Minesweeper here so that you know I once looked at a computer five years ago"""

mc clanahan,isn't all language a type of code
Danny McClanahan,"PMs can code, right?"
Max Care,Actually it was all PMs
Bradley Faskowitz,Computer scientists are not engineers
GroupMe,Conor Joplin changed the group's name to Microsoft goes pretty fucking hard
hoegrammer,this entire chat is just engineers trying to prove to engineers that engineers party
mc clanahan,the only female on my side of the building was an intern last year

At one point, she found the wifi to be $21.50 for the whole flight.  Quickly, she asked me, ""Oh, wait, can I use my mobile hotspot on my phone to connect to the Internet.""  --""no ma'am, you need cell service to do that"""

mc clanahan,don't fuck me over max
mc clanahan,no actually there are posters on the wall telling you to turn in your comrades for conduct unbefitting an employee
Phillip Hawkins,^are you allowed to say bad things about bill gates?
mc clanahan,too bad we're not actually in the 80s then I could beat up ol billy gates and tell him to make less shitty computers
mc clanahan,nice that's almost fast enough to pretend we're stuck in the 80s
Max Care,Which is sort of better than no WiFi?
Max Care,"Its also 90 here, but our WiFi is like 200 kb/s "
hoegrammer,use your voice. make a change. write a shitty yelp review. 
mc clanahan,the fuck
Max Care,"I would invite you over, but Matt's parents are here and using the car. "
mc clanahan,yeah I think I read that somewhere
Phillip Hawkins,I think hell is like that
mc clanahan,my hotel room is 90 degrees and I have no wifi someone kill me
mc clanahan,*snaps*
hoegrammer,isn't that what all tech does
mc clanahan,he's trying to replace you with a plastic robot slave? 
hoegrammer,the tech evangelist is chill tho he's using a kinect to 3D print models of all of us
hoegrammer,tl;dr computers are rad but image recognition is just nuts
mc clanahan,the problem with google's thing is that it's active research presented as a finished product
Mark,The problem with googles thing is that it generalized too much. It probably never had to distinguish between gorillas and black people because specifically training it to do so would be more racist than the ai mixing them up on accident
hoegrammer,yeah I mean obviously it IS better in some way or they wouldn't have made that claim. like I can't tell the difference between two bar codes but clearly a scanner can
Max Care,"(I made up the 100x part, I actually have no idea)"
Conor Joplin,Wait there are people besides straight white dudes?
Max Care,"Also, the claim of it being better than humans isn't that tenuous, if they were talking about specific categories. Like face recognition. Computers are just as accurate, and like 100 times faster. "
hoegrammer,turns out it was only tested on dudes
hoegrammer,I know last year some girls at a camp were having trouble implementing voice recognition software until they dropped the pitch of their voice a ton
mc clanahan,average human at google is white male so
hoegrammer,"did their initial data set for ""people"" not include pictures of black people or"
mc clanahan,"but people want it now, damn it"
Mark,No that's the cool thing. So you can learn and research but also make money 
mc clanahan,so it takes a long time to understand a lot of the research because it's complex and still developing
mc clanahan,the problem with machine learning is that it's both academic and corporate
Mark,"Yeah very silly claim. I disagree with danny. I am in the computer biz sp one day i can make an ai and play god. But did anyone see googles I photos thinking black people were gorillas and Google said ""holy fuck"""
mc clanahan,possibly satanic
mc clanahan,overhyped
mc clanahan,it's useless
mc clanahan,fuck machine vision
hoegrammer,"yeah, but the claim that they're ""better than humans"" now is pretty misleading"
Mark,"I mean it's getting better, you don't have to shit on it"
Mark,Yup
hoegrammer,I mean animal vision as in including humans?
Mark,About the copying natural world thing. Neural networks are so useful because it models the brain in that it learns the same way for any sense whether it be sight or hearing or whatever. So who cares how animals see
mc clanahan,the number of credits for cs majors here is literally ridiculous
mc clanahan,amped as fcuk
hoegrammer,I can't take it bc I have no space in my schedule... 18 credits till I graduate who's pumped?????
hoegrammer,oh jk
hoegrammer,bodenheimer?
mc clanahan,laibinis and I are homies
mc clanahan,I was gonna do scicomp cause the guy who teaches it is rad
Max Care,I would take it if you taught it Danny. I'd probably have to record ever lecture and play it back at 1/4 speed though. 
hoegrammer,I would actually totally take a scientific computing class if it counted for shit in the CS major
mc clanahan,I'll fucking teach 201 how about that
mc clanahan,201 is the reason I'm in cs tairas doesn't deserve to spit on roth's shoes
hoegrammer,I feel 0 guilt
hoegrammer,he totally knew too... because he also sat in on Roth's class and took notes to lecture off of later
mc clanahan,literally cannot believe he was allowed to sully the good name of roth's 201
mc clanahan,^clutch move
hoegrammer,remember when I took his 201 class and only went to Roth's section except for test days
Emma Birdsong,JUST DO IT..maybe..if you feel like it.. *said into the board*
Emma Birdsong,I want to see Tairas do a TEDtalk. 
hoegrammer,(help me.........)
hoegrammer,I love my majors...
hoegrammer,looool I'm so excited
Emma Birdsong,Took  tairas's MATLAB class irl. Was awful. 
mc clanahan,the thought of more tairas makes me want to shove me head in a used toilet and drink deeply
mc clanahan,LOL tairas
mc clanahan,like yes knowing one implies the other but you can have image recognition without copying the natural world
hoegrammer,ALSO I'm coding for a neuro lab for research credit this year and have to learn MatLab so I'm taking Tairas's coursera course #blessed
mc clanahan,ok but we don't have to know how animal vision works to make a neural net that works
hoegrammer,and mark I'm not sure but my neuro professor showed us that picture sooo idk
hoegrammer,"yeah that's why current deep neural networks kind of suck in practice since we haven't even really figured out how animal image recognition works when viewpoints change (lighting, angles, etc)"
Mark,I thought that the gorilla I'm your image was classified as a gorilla then the AI changed the picture to look more like what a gorilla looks like
mc clanahan,ai is pseudoscience
I have a LISP,Oh odd
Max Care,"IIRC, the school bus was modified by the neural net that classified it originally, with the intent of making it look like something else. Its like an optical illusion, but one that doesn't make sense to people. "
I have a LISP,"That's because training a neural network based on an image naturally takes into account the position. The general solution to that problem is to move things around in the image when you're trying to find a match, but that takes a long time"
I have a LISP,I believe that's because neural networks have trouble identifying two identical images if the subject has been moved in the photo.
hoegrammer,school bus on the left is a school bus. school bus on the right is an ostrich. aight
hoegrammer,"well according to one deep neural network (I forget which company's), this is a gorilla so"
mc clanahan,fucking sick burn bro
I have a LISP,Maybe she meant to say that it's smarter than tech evangelists
hoegrammer,image recognition*
hoegrammer,"also cannot deal with the title ""tech evangelist"" who r u"
hoegrammer,tbh the main reason there isn't any good image software is because we still don't know how people recognize images
Emma Birdsong,Depends on your human sample 
Mark,At least it doesn't think black people are gorillas
William Otte,I'm highly skeptical.
hoegrammer,#fuckyourmachinelearning
I have a LISP,Lol
hoegrammer,I just gave a lecture on why it sucks
hoegrammer,Microsoft tech evangelist tried to tell my students that their image recognition computer is now better than humans

I have a LISP,"Somewhat amused at the candidates cheating, my teammate remembered that on the first question, which was to check if a string is a palindrome, the candidate came up with a very elegant solution for the (more difficult) problem of determining if an integer is a palindrome. When asked to convert the problem to strings, the candidate struggled. Looking back, it all began to make sense...."
William Otte,Was this a live interview? 
I have a LISP,"A guy on my team interviewed a candidate today. He asked a string manipulation problem where you have a string that represents a path on Linux, e.g. ""~/foo/bar/baz"". Question is to implement a few commands, the first being cd, to manipulate that string. After 10 minutes of nothing, the candidate wrote a 30-40 line bash script (already wth worthy) that calls the commands cd and ls and stuff. Somewhat impressed with the candidates bash abilities, but confused that the script didn't really solve the problem at hand, my teammate came back and told us this story. We started googling around, and sure enough, on the 3rd or 4th answer down on a random Linux shell question, there was the candidates script."

Who?,And I bet they're all married to the same guy
I have a LISP,"Fun fact: there are 3 women in the Book of Mormon (my copy is over 500 pages long) and one of the women is a whore. Remember, this book covers 1000 years (600BC to 400AD) of early American history."
mc clanahan,today is the worst day ever
mc clanahan,fuck that reminds me I don't have any more clean underwear
Conor Joplin,The old 'banana in a trash bag trick!' I remember doing that back in the day
hoegrammer,ah yes temple garments
I have a LISP,They have special symbols on them but you can't see them unless you're up close.
I have a LISP,"""Garments"""
Max Care,Are those magic Mormon underwear?
I have a LISP,
mc clanahan,nothing makes me more content than coming home at the end of a long day and learning what the vanderbilt computer science department got up to that day
mc clanahan,cumpooters is the highlight of my day
Max Care,"""Cumpooters,"" always a source of enlightening discussion. "
hoegrammer,"obviously, not really great records"
hoegrammer,I mean Jewish religion goes back as far as 400-1200BC or so
Mark,"My point is since their culture relied on the people actually existing they had to keep them alive and having babies. Like, roman and greek culture were and are very pervasive because they didn't care who you were born to"
I have a LISP,*Woops
I have a LISP,Woods
I have a LISP,"^speaking of which, the part of the Book of Mormon I'm reading has a ton of passages about converting people to Judaism and was supposedly written in... 590BC"
hoegrammer,"well yeah, evangelism isn't really their thing"
I have a LISP,I would be very surprised if that were true.
Mark,"I read that ensuring procreation was the only thing keeping the Hebrews alive. They had no kingdom, no math, etc and treated themselves like gods chosen people and wouldn't breed with others. So things like homosexuality, masturbating, and pulling out were forbidden. Something like that, idgaf"
GroupMe,dope ass motherfucker changed name to mc clanahan
hoegrammer,even with Black Americans the issue is a lot more complicated because of race and heteromasculinity AYY
dope ass motherfucker,^^^^^^^^^^^
Conor Joplin,They gave more fucks to* their cows
dope ass motherfucker,most people couldn't even read in 1000 bc I feel like they probs gave more fucks about the health of their cows
hoegrammer,oh ofc this analysis really only applies to US white Christian history
Mark,What about during antiquity?
hoegrammer,a*
hoegrammer,the concept of same-sex attraction as an sexuality is relatively new
hoegrammer,"I mean up until the early 1900's homosexuality was just considered another aberrant sexual act, like adultery or premarital sex"
dope ass motherfucker,:)
I have a LISP,"@Conor Joplin Oh totally. It's the official stance of my own church, though we allow condoms :)"
dope ass motherfucker,my headphones just broke fuck this
Max Care,@I have a LISP Everyone knows you don't need to be educated on the topic to have a totally entrenched opinion that you violently defend. Haven't you ever been on the internet?
Conor Joplin,"Sorry I'm a tad (pretty) drunk rn, but that's the official stance of the Catholic church and most other Christian churches. The official understanding is that you should love everyone refardless of race/sexuality/whatever else, but that homosexual acts are a sin because they cannot lead to children, which is the point of sex. Besically it's about as bad as using a condom/BC"
I have a LISP,Sorry for blasting the channel guyz... It's good to vent though :)
dope ass motherfucker,well that's refreshing
I have a LISP,"Oh and to answer your question Danny, against gay marriage, some Mormons are against gays in general but that's a cultural thing. The churches official stance is that you have to stay chaste."
I have a LISP,"Of course, his economic theory is ultra conservative. He's totally against welfare and any form of gvmt provided healthcare, which is nuts."
I have a LISP,He's super super smart.
I have a LISP,"Funny thing is, my roommate who thinks that stuff is a total stud in economics and has already gone to two conferences this summer to present papers on taxation policy. Sounds like he has a legit shot at a top grad school too."
dope ass motherfucker,lol religion
I have a LISP,"On the contrary, my programmer coworkers and much more fair about it. Their big concern is that their temples will be forced to do gay marriages (which is a totally legitimate concern)."
Mark,Maybe they haven't paid any attention to the other countries that allow gay marriage
I have a LISP,"Because it ""encourages sin."""
I have a LISP,He literally thinks that society will have more crime and crumble apart if gays can marry.
I have a LISP,"It varies person to person, but my estimate is that 90% of the Mormons here in Utah are vehemently against legalization of gay marriage. As my roommate so aptly explained, ""society will be less moral and therefore less stable and ready for Jesus to return if we allow gay marriage."" "
dope ass motherfucker,so aaron are they not big on The Gays in general or same sex marriage specifically
I have a LISP,#forevermarriages
I have a LISP,#zion
I have a LISP,@Mark lol gotta love nephi floating on over to America to start his own civilization! 
I have a LISP,"@Conor Joplin Totally - all of the people I have talked about the flaws of Mormon faith with have been exceptionally civil (in fact, I just finished yet another one with my roommate). The only conversation that went south was one about gay marriage with my other roommate."
I have a LISP,@Max Care How can I disagree with their religion if I haven't read their holy book?
I have a LISP,Yeah my roommates and one of my coworkers go on that many dates. It's absurd
Phillip Hawkins,yoooo I remember that one
dope ass motherfucker,cause he went out with 5 different girls at once!!!!
dope ass motherfucker,with that guy everyone called the pentagon
dope ass motherfucker,reminds me of that one episode of zoey 101
hoegrammer,my friend at BYU goes on like 3-4 dates every weekend 
hoegrammer,dating is serious shit though
Mark,Aw that's nice of them
Conor Joplin,"To be fair, Mormons take all the shit they get really well. I worked with a few last year and they joked around with me about it, and instead of getting outraged about The Book of Mormon they just asked the actors to tell the audience to donate to AIDS prevention in Africa and handed out LDS flyers outside the theater, at least in St. Louis"
Emma Birdsong,^those sound like types of flooring
Mark,How else you gonna know about the nephites and laminites?
dope ass motherfucker,"that shit is the bomb wait till the dj drops ""I'm blue"""
William Otte,To pull them hot mormon babes? 
Max Care,Q: why on earth are you reading the book of Mormon. 
dope ass motherfucker,have they invited you to one of their dances yet
I have a LISP,"My roommate keeps asking me if I've ""felt the spirit"" while reading it and I'm like no f*** you."
Mark,"I don't get how you can read the history of lds and joseph Smith without rationalizing it any way other than ""this is just a fun thing my family and I do"" "
Conor Joplin,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=06jF1EG8o-Q
I have a LISP,I'm reading the Book of Mormon rn and it is the single strangest book I have ever read
Danny's Arch Nemesis,I thought south park was the go-to handbook on mormonism
Emma Birdsong,There's a documentary on netflix called I escaped a cult or something like that and it talks about the LDS and Joseph Smith and it's really interesting but also freaky af
Conor Joplin,"The Mormons see your hate, and instead of raising you turn it off like a light switch"
I have a LISP,I don't think they play it in Utah though haha
I have a LISP,No but I'm sure as hell gonna see it now
Mark,Ever seen book of Mormon? I love it. Doesn't really bash them which is nice
Mark,^word
I have a LISP,"In my opinion, they're all culty ones, just different levels of cultiness"
I have a LISP,Ohhh
Emma Birdsong,"No really I saw it in a documentary. It's not all Mormons though, just the culty ones"
I have a LISP,@Emma Birdsong I don't think that's a thing....
William Otte,Gotta love white Jesus
Emma Birdsong,"See how he's also wearing red? The church of Latter Day Saints also believes that no one can wear red except for Jesus. So like, no one can steal Jesus' aesthetic"
I have a LISP,"Also, if you can't get into celestial heaven without being married and bearing children, then where are the twelve apostles? #morefoodforthought"
I have a LISP,"If Mormon Jesus had a beard, then why can't Mormons have beards? #foodforthought"

Emma Birdsong,And someone is going to pay those people more than they pay us 
hoegrammer,I literally cannot think of anything I care less about than your previous haircare routine
dope ass motherfucker,sounds like a group of children well adjusted to society and human contact
hoegrammer,"people I met at Internapalooza:
- the very average-haired rando who stopped me to ask how long it takes me to do my hair in the morning. when I told him I just brushed it, he was like ""no, how long does it take to dry??? when my hair was chin length it took like two whole minutes and I HATED it."" I said ""I don't know.""
- the kid in front of me who insisted that the Airbnb recruiter take two of his resume because ""it's just that good."" when I started talking to her and said I didn't bring a resume, he was like, ""here, just give her mine!!""
- the kid who grabbed like 5 Palantir shirts without talking to any of the recruiters and just walked away.
- the dickwad who waited in the BlackRock line for straight up 5 minutes before he was all ""wait. This isn't Yahoo"" (Yahoo was next booth over). Asked me what BlackRock was, and when I explained, was like, ""well, I should really be talking to the big companies like Yahoo and VMware,"" and left."

dope ass motherfucker,this group is a clique

I have a LISP,So it's a modified traveling salesman 
Mark,Yep. And we can use Google api
I have a LISP,Oh so there _are_ distances
Mark,"Yeah so like verizon places are 10 pts, NBA stadiums are 8 pts, each state is 3 pts, etc. Given 224 hours, 1 hour at each place, constant 65 mph. "
I have a LISP,There has to be a cost for going to the cities right? Or it's not a hard problem
I have a LISP,Or just point values for the best cities?
I have a LISP,Does the question have distances between the places?
Connor Joplin,Tell them to split the first vertex. Problem solved

I have a LISP,at the bar I was at last week they came through and id'd only the Mexican guys and kicked a ton of them out. And these guys were definitely older then me. It was ridiculous
hoegrammer,is it in the manual
hoegrammer,what is with bartenders and that joke
Max Care,"So at a team event last week, one of the bartenders asked me for ID. She held a straight face for like 5 seconds, then was like NAH JUST MESSING WITH YOU"
William Otte,And I mean like legit covered in plaster 
William Otte,I am like super old. I'm a professor 
Mark,But you're too young that's illegal and immoral anyway
William Otte,Everyone's plastered 
William Otte,My house. Massive party 
Mark,Going where?
Connor Joplin,Gotta get that quick networking kn before going out
Connor Joplin,Ahh #tru
Max Care,It's only 7
Max Care,"Time zones, bruh."
Connor Joplin,S/O to @Max Care for accepting my LinkedIn request late on a Friday night
üçÜ,Yup
Connor Joplin,Oh my b
hoegrammer,no Jamie
Connor Joplin,"Nope, thought about it before though"
hoegrammer,aren't you a bartender 
Connor Joplin,The mojitos are just a test. Every Cuban drinks Cuba libres
Connor Joplin,"Tell them ""Cubas libres son los mejores"""
üçÜ,Help they just made mojitos. Help my office is actually cuba. 
Mark,We finally got our verizon selfie sticks today so i know what I'll  be doing the rest of the day/month/summer/life
Danny's Arch Nemesis,The naked bike parade is actually really cool though in that it's a complete shitshow
Max Care,Shaun is trying to convince me to join a naked bike parade with him. Never a dull moment here in Advanta A 4105
hoegrammer,"""do you understand what a repository is or what Git does?""
""yeah Sarah (teacher) just explained it. sort of.""
""... so not really?""
""not at all"""
hoegrammer,we are trying to teach Git and BitBucket to the girls. it is not going well. 
dŒøpe ass motherfucker,Bazinga 
William Otte,Yeah it's the thing you call when you see a cockroach 
dope ass motherfucker,true but linux motherfuckers are far more likely to know what a debugger is
Danny McClanahan,b/c linux sux
dope ass motherfucker,but not on linux...
dope ass motherfucker,spotify on windows crashes itself if you open up a debugger at all
William Otte,It is compiled 
William Otte,Hey he's half right 
Max Care,"Shaun just tried to convince me that it's safe to put your private key in applications because ""it's compiled so they can't get it"""
Mark,800 B/s on my neighbor's wifi. I should really tell them to upgrade.
William Otte,Fios ftw
Mark,Oh nice! Lucky dog
dŒøpe ass motherfucker,Fucking .1mb/sec download speed at my house rn. Fml 
William Otte,Smaller boat can be nice for playing though. Easier to throw around 
dŒøpe ass motherfucker,"Rpm. It was actually pretty fun, but I like the axiom 8.5 that I've been using"
William Otte,What kind? 
dŒøpe ass motherfucker,Ergh!
dŒøpe ass motherfucker,"Sorry. Was at dinner. So we were out of boats my size, so I had to squeeze into one that was way too small. "
Danny's Arch Nemesis,What a tease
Mark,Don't leave us hanging
Max Care,"Yeah, help us live vicariously through you. "
dope ass motherfucker,what kind of boat was it
William Otte,Tell us Turner 
dŒøpe ass motherfucker,Yall would not believe the boat I had to paddle today. 
Bradley Faskowitz,"^yea, that was actually probably one of the stupidest points I have ever made and I'm sorry you spend the time reading that"
Bradley Faskowitz,Some people have different talents 
I have a LISP,But it's not me...
I have a LISP,His name is Aaron 
I have a LISP,I'm pretty sure one guy on my team of 4 writes 95% of the new code and everyone else just fixes bugs.
Mark,"They've been really understanding of my view that verizon sucks, let's change it."
dope ass motherfucker,hahaha mark
dope ass motherfucker,brad I guess the reason I wouldn't call it a paradigm change is because people have been using non javascript languages for a while with transpilers and whatnot
Mark,"Wow. Boy am I glad I've been building my app from scratch! Although, I still don't have access to anything and have just been modifying their framework theme to look like android..."
dope ass motherfucker,seriously though when I started playing with atom I just cloned react and included that instead of the minified so I could debug more easily
dope ass motherfucker,I was going to ask if there waa documentation but then I remembered this is microsoft
dope ass motherfucker,you can't work directly off the unminified source?
Danny's Arch Nemesis,Classic msoft
dope ass motherfucker,what the fuck
Max Care,"It's enough to say that anytime my code has an error, the back trace is 20 calls deep(all minified names) and ends in my code being called with eval. "
I have a LISP,"I better start working on my haskell to webassembly compiler. And yes, it will integrate with haskshell"
Bradley Faskowitz,"Well, I mean, the paradigm is that JavaScript is the end all be all, but here is an alternative, which still uses much of the same stuff but is still different"
Max Care,"Which reminds me Danny, I need to tell you about the abomination of a js framework that I have to work in. "
dope ass motherfucker,I mean idk about a change in paradigm it seems like they're really just making a fast form of javascript; it's still gonna be distributed and run in basically the same way
Bradley Faskowitz,"It'd be a change in paradigm, so I guess it's a big deal in that respect"
dope ass motherfucker,languages are dumb massive projects
dope ass motherfucker,formats are easy to hack around with
dope ass motherfucker,I really like that it's a format and not a language
Bradley Faskowitz,This was just posted in the hackathon hackers group on Facebook but I'd thought I'd share because it could be a pretty big deal: http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/17/google-microsoft-mozilla-and-others-team-up-to-launch-webassembly-a-new-binary-format-for-the-web/?ncid=rss&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29&utm_content=FaceBook
dope ass motherfucker,dat cs lyfe doe
I have a LISP,My roommates have girlfriends now and Mormons can't have girls in their rooms so they trade off nights on the couch with their gf and I'm just stuck in my room.
dŒøpe ass motherfucker,Just told like 80 kids the most ridiculous drawn out story. 
Mark,I finally met the other interns today and they probably thought I was way too giddy because I finally got to talk to another human.
hoegrammer,the interns at Microsoft are every CS major I've ever met
dŒøpe ass motherfucker,I'm just kayaking and riding my motorcycle everyday. 
dŒøpe ass motherfucker,I'm losing it. 
Max Care,"I was like, no shit, most people think about bit first. "
William Otte,Dude I like hiking! 
Max Care,He was complaining to me about how much of a process it was to buy a nice engagement ring
Danny's Arch Nemesis,Is it true that Microsoft is all white family men who like to hike?
Max Care,Alan: Two months
William Otte,He sounds like he's a good worker! 
Max Care,So he also spent a good portion of today on the phone. I took off my headphones(mistake) and heard him talking about how their kids won't get sick because they'll have good genetics. 
William Otte,Also he recently started dating her and was shopping for engagement rings? 
William Otte,Max come on! Letting the team down 
hoegrammer,watched Napoleon Dynamite a few too many times
Max Care,I'll keep you guys updated from now on. There's something new every day. 
dope ass motherfucker,^
Mark,Whoa why have you not told us stories until now?
Max Care,"So the intern I share an office with is one of the strangest people i've ever met. The first day I met him he told me that he recently started dating ""a kinky black woman who gets turned on by white nerdy guys"". He spent all of today and yesterday shopping for engagement rings online. "
hoegrammer,"""that is, if you can ignore the 3 other roommates in my 1br"""
Connor Joplin,"""I'll be at the office so my bed's free"""
Connor Joplin,"""You can stay at my place tonight if you want"""
Mark,Whoa Whoa whoa don't go bashing manchildren. That's toxic af
hoegrammer,"""only free on weekends"" aka ""my startup orders pizza most nights and I'm a perpetual manchild"""
Connor Joplin,"""Would take you for a ride"""
I have a LISP,Watch out for liquidation though

I have a LISP,Better lock down those preferred options

I have a LISP,
Emma Birdsong,But since you're in Lexington you should go tour West Sixth Brewing. They have this really cool sustainability chain where they use the grains from brewing to feed tilapia and then the waste from the tilapia to fertilize greens and they serve all of it in a restaurant in the same building. It's also in an old bread factory which is cool.

Mark,Holy cow.    At least I got two free giant whiteboards.
Connor Joplin,I got a new Mac and iPad Air
Max Care,
Mark,Oh also the lead developer hasn't even agreed to lead this project yet.
Mark,I found 2 lcd monitors among a bunch of CRTs
Danny's Arch Nemesis,Do you use a CRT monitor?
William Otte,What does that even mean 
dŒøpe ass motherfucker,Oh my god. 
Mark,"I have fun stories about my first day today. I have a 5 year old hp with 4gb of ram and since they're throwing all their old stuff away I literally had to get in giant boxes filled with keyboards, mice, etc from mid2000s to pick out tools. My team is starting to port the software to mobile..also I'm the only one on my team (and only intern in the office) here because the rest are in training in case they have to do manual labor during a strike. "
Phillip Hawkins,^what a hipster
dope ass motherfucker,I use c++ for android development
Danny's Arch Nemesis,React native soon ‚Ñ¢ brah
Max Care,Xamarin brah. 
William Otte,Android is all in java isn't it? 
dope ass motherfucker,use c# it has that
William Otte,It took me a day of developing in java/android to miss the auto keyword from c++ more than is normal 
dope ass motherfucker,motherphockers
hoegrammer,everyone come to San Francisco we just had pho
hoegrammer,he shrugged
dope ass motherfucker,ask jeff how his react adventures are going
hoegrammer,
GroupMe,Conor Joplin changed name to Connor Joplin
Bradley Faskowitz,"If Connor doesn't care, I don't care"
Mark,ÔøΩ you
Conor Joplin,"Thank you, Mark"
Mark,"I think hating on dtd is ok. You're not really hating on the people, just what their organization does, like throw lame parties."
I have a LISP,https://camo.githubusercontent.com/92a0e6c8cfa3aae0e70f442fc915263ee59bf5bf/687474703a2f2f6d656469612e74756d626c722e636f6d2f74756d626c725f6c74757a6a766251364c31717a677078392e676966
Emma Birdsong,"I think we all just need a lil Ted talk from Shia LaBeouf

Conor Joplin,"Chill, they were jokes"
Bradley Faskowitz,"Don't hate on dtd.  Hating on a group of people, all of whom you've probably never met, is toxic af."
dope ass motherfucker,also everything that happened that night
dope ass motherfucker,yeah yoko I forget why there was so much excitement
Matt Lee,who the hell is danny?
Conor Joplin,Drunk Danny and sober Danny are about the same person
Emma Birdsong,Who is rani?
hoegrammer,tbt when a very drunk Danny and a very sober Rani met for the first time and Danny was so excited to meet Rani that we were actually kind of confused
hoegrammer,rani is also the only reason I know anybody though? so
Max Care,"Conor let me drink about twice as much, and then I'll try to figure out what you're saying. "
hoegrammer,or rani
hoegrammer,tbh I only really know delts via VOB
Conor Joplin,Yoko you know how a square is a rectangle but a rectangle isn't necessarily a square? That's how VoB and DTD parties are
Conor Joplin,"Just ruins your day man, I feel ya"
dope ass motherfucker,I'm sorry I'm super hangry I woke up too late for breakfast and didn't wanna make any food so I had denny's but that was like 12 hours ago
Conor Joplin,"So are hairstyles, that doesn't mean you do them right"
Matt Lee,also i dont think anyone minds having their moms lady parts not give out homecoming shirts and ice cream
hoegrammer,I've been to a DTD party!!! that or a VOB party. is there a difference??
dope ass motherfucker,english is a constantly evolving language
Matt Lee,too*
dope ass motherfucker,to bad your mom can't say the same thing about her vagina
Emma Birdsong,I'm gonna jump in and say that DTD gave us cool af homecoming t shirts and jeni's so I like DTD 
Conor Joplin,And then I feel better
Conor Joplin,"I'd feel really, really bad about myself, but then I look in the mirror and realize I don't have a pink mop on my head"
Conor Joplin,Right there. Ouch.
Conor Joplin,"Danny, you know that place?"
Conor Joplin,#alcohol
dope ass motherfucker,heavy drinking is the only way to get through a dtd party
Conor Joplin,Yeah I'm super cool didn't you hear?
dope ass motherfucker,I mean he probably has a super high tolerance
Max Care,Because you have incredibly good grammar for drinking that much. 
Conor Joplin,Nah bruh I'm texting you with 2 40s duct taped to my hands
Max Care,"Conor, did you finish your 40s yet?"
Conor Joplin,That comment just hurt me in that place
Conor Joplin,"So deep inside of you, that science has yet to put a name to it?"
Conor Joplin,"Like the part inside of you that's so deep, you don't know it's there until a loved one dies?"
Conor Joplin,"Danny, you know that core part of your being?"
Matt Lee,^LOL HOLY SHIT DANNY
dope ass motherfucker,2 girls? dtd should be taking notes
Conor Joplin,"You think I'm kidding, but I'm not"
hoegrammer,oh my lord why did I choose this career
Conor Joplin,"Which is better than the intern ratio, which currently sits at 17:1"
Conor Joplin,"Hey there were like, 2 girls"
dope ass motherfucker,yeah conor I bet they were all nerds
Conor Joplin,"42 actually, we had 19 people with a normal number of appendages and one mutant"
Max Care,So that makes 80 40 hands?
Conor Joplin,"Bitch please, we just had 20 people all do Edward 40 hands at the same time"
Conor Joplin,You're missing out if you aren't in Seattle?
Max Care,Vandy it probably owns a few. 
Mark,Oh cool I love jamming!
dŒøpe ass motherfucker,http://www.ladyada.net/make/wavebubble/
dope ass motherfucker,fuck off mark my phone is a computer
Mark,Seattle is VandyWest
dope ass motherfucker,yo if y'all aren't in seattle rn you're missing out
Mark,Photoshopped. There's not a computer nearby

Bradley Faskowitz,I looked it up.

Bradley Faskowitz,"Yo if anybody plays dungeons and dragons, I'm game.  I won't be dungeon master I'll play."
I have a LISP,No lie I would do a pokemon larp
Bradley Faskowitz,Define larp
dope ass motherfucker,I have this friend here who does some hardcore larp you should join
GroupMe,Terrified of groupme pic added Ethan Raymond to the group
William Otte,Hell yeah I would
dope ass motherfucker,otte would wear that t shirt
hoegrammer,"I once saw a company shirt that said ""the code never bothered me anyway"" nothing surprises me anymore"
Conor Joplin,I think this is the class you really want
dope ass motherfucker,if you don't already know ruby then ruby koans is pretty helpful
Emma Birdsong,^glad to know the iOS one is good because I'm about to start it. Also any tips for learning Ruby on Rails? Rly wanna work for Bleacher Report 
Conor Joplin,The classes on Stanford U are usually pretty good. I picked up iOS using one
hoegrammer,@üçÜ  yes!!
üçÜ,Wait are you going to girls who code training in nyc next week?
hoegrammer,IN ENTIRELY UNRELATED NEWS: does anyone know of a really good Python- or JavaScript-for-programmers MOOC I can take? I have to teach those in like two weeks and I have never worked with either
hoegrammer,"but it's also a lot different because it's only undergrad, which probably doesn't bode well for rankings but attracts a lot of students here bc more personalized instruction"
hoegrammer,"I know a few people who have gone to MSM, Juilliard, Rice for grad and that's a really big deal"
hoegrammer,"not sure exactly, and I don't think USN&WR does music school rankings, but I believe so. it's a relatively new school and it used to not be considered all that great, but it's really quickly becoming a lot more recognized"
Emma Birdsong,Blair is also more highly ranked right?
hoegrammer,I guess there are fewer of them though
hoegrammer,I'm sure Blair is on some sort of different budget. Every Blair professor seems to drive a mad souped up ride.
Max Care,"Also I transfered in, so that's +1"
Terrified of groupme pic,^compEs also benefit from CS so those numbers go up
Mark,"Also, the percussion department hired consultants this year to pimp the program "
Mark,"I'm fully serious though, the program has gotten bigger but the faculty has not.  17 were in our class at the beginning of freshman year, and that number has quintupled. 34 freshmen started for the class of 2018."
I have a LISP,We can slap the VandyApps name on it too (and Vandy cs?)
William Otte,Cuz we hate fun and having professors
I have a LISP,Why not?
William Otte,No we won't sign it
I have a LISP,Oh god I just restarted 
I have a LISP,I can write it if you will help me get sigs

Mark,Signed - the dynamic brogramming groupme 
Danny's Arch Nemesis,"It was Yale, danny and I were going to get started but then I got lazy"
William Otte,Yuh
Max Care,I'd help with that. 
Mark,"Oh I forgot to mention, doug Schmidt talked about some cs kids at harvard(?) sending a letter to the administration saying hire more cs faculty and wanted us to do that too "
I have a LISP,Second time that's happened here
I have a LISP,Lol all the bands I see say they're from Nashville and I'm the only one in the crowd who cheers for thay
I have a LISP,
dope ass motherfucker,wtf
I have a LISP,And I'm in the back 
I have a LISP,Guys I'm literally 10 ft from the stage
I have a LISP,Lol
Emma Birdsong,The first VandyApps meeting I went to someone proposed making an app that helps you remember when your clubs are meeting. It was amazing. 
dope ass motherfucker,~~cs love~~
dope ass motherfucker,yeah I think we're definitely all agreed on that
I have a LISP,"It's not a zero sum game... If we help each other, we help ourselves. "
I have a LISP,"The moral of the story is, yes, you can improve Vanderbilt cs outcome, and the most surefire way to do that is by coming to and supporting the Vanderbilt programming community at VandyApps!"
Bradley Faskowitz,"And yes, there is a lack of institutional funding in the CS department and this is something we should change."
Bradley Faskowitz,"And the Harvard thing is bullshit because everyone assumes that someone who goes to Harvard is a genius, when really, that isn't true.  Only a select few are admitted on sheer brilliance."
Bradley Faskowitz,"Well one of the reasons why they recruit at a place like gt is because they just have so many more students, meaning that even if there are fewer quality students by percent, there are way more by numbers.  Same with a Michigan or a Berkeley.  More students, more talent in the pool.  "
dope ass motherfucker,like the reason I'm insistent on thus is because this is something **we** can change
dope ass motherfucker,all my friends at harvard got microsoft after their frosh year
dope ass motherfucker,brad that sounds great but we're totally not on equal playing field
Emma Birdsong,"Thanks for the pep talk, coach!"
Bradley Faskowitz,"But sometimes you just have to go after it rather than let them go after you.  If you show that you have more motivation than an average 5th grade prepubescent in trying to pursue opportunities, you will be on an equal if not better playing field.  As long as you've got the talent to back it up, you'll do fine."
Conor Joplin,
Bradley Faskowitz,^this is a good point.
dope ass motherfucker,the fact that nobody really gives a fuck about recruiting vandy kids is evidence that it's not respected in computer science
dope ass motherfucker,the average gt student couldn't get in to vandy
dope ass motherfucker,ok but relying on stats is misleading
Emma Birdsong,Honestly my biggest concern is who is recruiting us but I think that is gonna get better with time 
Bradley Faskowitz,"To be honest, it doesn't look much different, we are just on a smaller scale"
Bradley Faskowitz,"It's hard to see, but here are their career outcomes"
Bradley Faskowitz,"For reference, this is Georgia tech's college of computing, which is ranked in the top 10, top 5 in some polls, which hosts computer science"
dope ass motherfucker,fuck money
Emma Birdsong,Also you're forgetting that vanderbilt has more women in engineering than most schools so that probably fcks up the average salary too sry
dope ass motherfucker,ew children
Emma Birdsong,I'm just trying to graduate so I can pop out babies like my grandma wants 
Terrified of groupme pic,According to my mom my goal should be wearing more makeup and marrying rich so like seems to align well with the statistic
dope ass motherfucker,no but it's also silly to act like vandy is at all respected as a school for cs
üçÜ,Says the art major
Danny's Arch Nemesis,and it's not like working at the big 5 should be the end goal for everybody
Bradley Faskowitz,9/30 at the big 5 sounds pretty solid to me.
Danny's Arch Nemesis,i think those numbers are alright
Bradley Faskowitz,"I hate to be the positivity guy, now, but..."
Danny's Arch Nemesis,"ya in the class of 2015, which has around 30 or so people, there are 4 at microsoft, 1 at apple, 2 at google, and 2 at fb, and that's just the people i know"
Bradley Faskowitz,"Yea, I know nothing."
Bradley Faskowitz,"Wait, but let's make him count though... I think Jeff would help the cause .."
Emma Birdsong,There were ~30 in this year's graduating class
Bradley Faskowitz,"But what do I know?  I haven't technically declared a CS major yet.  lol
"
Max Care,You don't count. 
Max Care,Not you Jeff. 
Max Care,I think our class is going to do a lot better though. 
Bradley Faskowitz,"But really, I hear the CS program is in the ballpark of 80, and about 20 or so responses seem to have been recorded.  There is a lot of uncertainty there."
Bradley Faskowitz,It was more a matter of rhetoric than assuming you cannot read lol
Danny's Arch Nemesis,Also their class size is 24 lolololol
Emma Birdsong,What would you want to see Danny? I think I'm just thrilled to see almost everyone be employed or going to grad school haha
dope ass motherfucker,I'm gonna assume that's most people though
dope ass motherfucker,I can read brad
Bradley Faskowitz,"""Those are only the stats of people who actually said where they were going, too, so not all outcomes are represented"""
dope ass motherfucker,a single grad school? one to amazon apple and 2 to msft??? guys we gotta do something
dope ass motherfucker,wow that's shittier than I expected
Bradley Faskowitz,"Those are only the stats of people who actually said where they were going, too, so not all outcomes are represented"
Emma Birdsong,"http://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/docs/VUSE-Class-of-2014-Placement-Summary.pdf
Compared to other majors we do well but idk how we compare nationally "
dope ass motherfucker,"how do vandy grads ""do well"""
dope ass motherfucker,what does that percentage come out to
dope ass motherfucker,how many students?
dope ass motherfucker,how many people did we send to google? facebook? microsoft? 
Emma Birdsong,You wanna talk to an 8th grader from rural TN about why he should come to vandy then?
dope ass motherfucker,since when do vandy grads do well lo
Bradley Faskowitz,Fuck I'm really good at ruining a thread that was funny..
Bradley Faskowitz,*In the classic brad tone* I'm always about the positivity guyzz
Gas Pedal,but that's why we love you <3
Gas Pedal,Brad always with the positivity!
Bradley Faskowitz,"Right, so give this close community more teachers and see what we can be."
Danny's Arch Nemesis,Ya but I think that's because of our close community and good input rather than our schooling
Bradley Faskowitz,Now go back to talking about whales
Bradley Faskowitz,"Yes, Vanderbilt can do more, but the current output only shows that with a greater investment in the program, we can get even better output than our not too bad results already"
Bradley Faskowitz,"Right, Jeff, but also if you look at the output, somehow we still do fine."
Bradley Faskowitz,"Considering our class is around 80, the numbers we get with solid outcomes are great."
Danny's Arch Nemesis,"Oh I can do this: our school has fewer CS teaching and tenure track faculty than any other top 20 school, and we have fewer faculty per student of any top 20 by like 2x the second lowest"
Bradley Faskowitz,"Look, as much as I love shitting on our CS program, our grads tend to do well, and typically better than the average CS department.  Way better actually. "
Max Care,I actually think its likely to get better. I heard they're hiring more faculty. 
William Otte,Guys but do Band-Aids fix bullet holes? 
Emma Birdsong,^valid
Bradley Faskowitz,School*
Bradley Faskowitz,Rankings don't matter when your shook is constantly churning out talent #anchordown
Emma Birdsong,"Speaking of which, someone I graduated with wants her little brother to go to Vanderbilt and he wants to do CS and I'm just like how do I explain why he should look elsewhere without sounding whiny~"
William Otte,Was super interesting 
Bradley Faskowitz,Undergraduates at Vanderbilt tend to do well considering the not so solid reputation.
I have a LISP,Our undergrad has to be better than that 
William Otte,Yup. Read the USDA CA crop report 
I have a LISP,Brad speaking the truth
I have a LISP,Didn't realize that
Bradley Faskowitz,^grad program though. 
Max Care,(We're like 56th for CS)
dope ass motherfucker,#vandy #top20
William Otte,Like you lead the us and its one of the top 20 crops in CA 
William Otte,Y'all make a ton of rice Aaron 
Danny's Arch Nemesis,"Seriously I'm pretty sure I can wade through our ""Rio grande"" "
Emma Birdsong,But New Mexico has Navajo fry bread and I could survive on that alone 
Danny's Arch Nemesis,Heeyyyooooo
Emma Birdsong,Actually that was true starting in NM
Emma Birdsong,"The difference in greenery as I went west was like startling. And everything I saw in CA labeled a ""river"" was what I would call a ditch tbh. "
Mark,Aw that'd be cute 
I have a LISP,Maybe we'll have our own dust bowl
I have a LISP,That's a solid drive
Emma Birdsong,I just drove from TN to CA and the only place I saw rice was Arkansas
I have a LISP,^way to contrivufe
Danny's Arch Nemesis,If ups can ship whales by plane I'm pretty sure flying mules is no problem
I have a LISP,I don't think we make rice alan
I have a LISP,Doesn't California make like a huge portion of the food for the rest of the country
Carl Block,In rancho they're making people pay fines if they use too much water. Pretty sure that won't be effective
William Otte,In a drought don't farm rice n such
William Otte,The problem is what you farm 
I have a LISP,But I want food more than I want a green lawn
Mark,"That's bs, farms are the supermajority of water usage "
I have a LISP,With their lawns 
I have a LISP,That's gonna be hard for all those rich covenant bastards
Max Care,I want to try visiting Cuba some time. 
Carl Block,We're supposed to cut usage by 36% in olivenhain 
I have a LISP,It's been raining non stop in Utah so maybe they can pipe some into SD 
I have a LISP,Is it actually becoming a problem?
Carl Block,Aaron pretty sure there won't be any water left by the time you get here 
I have a LISP,SwiftKey was way more accurate on android
William Otte,I mean maybe they use a 747f variant and just turn the hold into a pasture 
I have a LISP,You can just road trip them
I have a LISP,That's why you should bring those mules to San Diego instwad
Emma Birdsong,Do they put them in cargo? That's inhumane
Max Care,*1000
William Otte,Also a million mules is a lot
Max Care,100 kilo mules?
Emma Birdsong,Is it expensive to fly all those mules?
I have a LISP,747s
William Otte,How do mules fly? 
I have a LISP,It's not as cool as Hawaii but you don't have to fly 1000k mules to get there
Mark,Can I stay in your mansion
dŒøpe ass motherfucker,I have seen it like at least 15 to 20 times
I have a LISP,Someone visit me in San Diego at the end of the summer 
William Otte,Also turner makes a good point. 
Mark,Uh I think I speak for me and turner when I say we've seen forgetting Sarah Marshall enough to know the spots
dŒøpe ass motherfucker,"Max, like literally we could just go any direction, find a beach and chill"
William Otte,Max we'll text you 
I have a LISP,"^the band, not the animal"
Max Care,"It would suck without me, because you don't know the spots, and no one else is going to show the tourists. "
I have a LISP,Someone come see the mountain goats with me tonight in Salt Lake city
dŒøpe ass motherfucker,"mark, what's your point?"
William Otte,Who needs max 
William Otte,Ok let's go to Hawaii then 
Mark,He's in seattle
William Otte,Guys let's go visit max in Hawaii 
dŒøpe ass motherfucker,"this allen. the lower half, not the falls"

William Otte,On both counts. 
William Otte,Ok I'm jealous 
dŒøpe ass motherfucker,also own a motorcycle now.
dŒøpe ass motherfucker,I did just get back from running some class 5 whitewater
William Otte,When my parents were out I had 4 people passed out in the basement

Rebecca Riley,"Once you hit print, just go to the copiers and print it out"
Rebecca Riley,"You don't select colored. When you get the dialog box on your vuPrint window, it should try to print color for you already"
Tiffany Silverstein,Im a compE so this is even less excusable....
Bradley Faskowitz,"Guyz, I'm a CS major I swear !!! "
Tiffany Silverstein,wait how? Im currently in central and i cant figure out how to select colored

Tiffany Silverstein,"""Always good advice"" from william roundtree otte"

Alan Samanta,Just pure gold 
Alan Samanta,His twitter is pure gold 
Danny McClanahan,a hero to us all
Conor Joplin,"Sidenote: If you are ever looking for good BBQ in Nashville, Alabama, Arkansas, St. Louis, or a host of other places, Otte has been kind enough to photo document his journey through those areas and more on his twitter page https://mobile.twitter.com/wrotte/media"
Tiffany Silverstein,"Like ""guys i swear im coming out i just gotta make my code better first"""
Tiffany Silverstein,TRUE
Alan Samanta,Also define hammered 
Conor Joplin,Tiffany remember when we talked about how we had to pregame alone at 12:01 every Friday/Saturday because of 251? Those were the days
Alan Samanta,Why can't we have a cs pregame 
Tiffany Silverstein,Being an engineer means drinking alone
Max Kerr,"I'm down, but pregaming at blakemore basically means drinking alone. "
Tiffany Silverstein,Else i will fuck you up danny
Danny McClanahan,else what
Tiffany Silverstein,*if
Tiffany Silverstein,Sidenote i will be angered of you are not all hammered at the fgh mixer tomorrow evening
Danny McClanahan,truuuuuu
Max Kerr,The perk of being a CS major: Nobody gives a shit that you look like a drug dealer/homeless person as long as you can write code. 
Danny McClanahan,fuck yes
Max Kerr,That is the plan
Turner Strayhorn,"max, do this again"
Turner Strayhorn,
Conor Joplin,"It's a lot easier to tear off a grass skirt than sweats, Max"
Max Kerr,I actually know a guy who can do that. Its insane. 
Max Kerr,And it should end with someone doing a backflip and tearing it off while in the air. 
Danny McClanahan,I fucking gagged
Tiffany Silverstein,Yea you're right we should add otte into the dance to tone it down
Turner Strayhorn,Maybe too much. 
Tiffany Silverstein,Or nah
Tiffany Silverstein,Wait can we get the full body tear off sweatsuits and choreograph a dance that involves them and includes a dance solo by danny????? 
Brittany Roth,Why not both?
Megan Woodruff,^^ only gonna design it if they are swish pants

Conor Joplin,So he can keep his shades on to block out all the haters
Brittany Roth,Pics or it didn't happen
Conor Joplin,"I got some pretty sick designs already made, long sleeve shirts for everyone and some Google croakies just for Danny"

Conor Joplin,I can't argue with that. Wish I was that #frat
Danny McClanahan,and yeah alan visions was a great time remember that time I started crying in front of everyone me too
Danny McClanahan,conor it's cause I'm fucking sexy
Mark Karle,I thought he asked too many damn questions to the professor. But really he asks an ok amount of questions.
Conor Joplin,How?
Conor Joplin,"I thought he was one of those weird antisocial guys, but then he posted a bathroom selfie of him wearing entirely salmon, and 134 people liked it"
Bradley Faskowitz,"#TBT to that time I, like everyone else in 251, thought Danny was a junior"
Alan Samanta,Danny remember visions last year? 
Danny McClanahan,I have many issues and all of them are tiffany silverstein's use of halfway ironic hashtags
Bradley Faskowitz,Now that I know Danny more I've realized that he still has some issues to sort out
Tiffany Silverstein,Danny is this the part where i tell everyone how we met and you were a #playerhater (yes the hashtag is necessary)
Bradley Faskowitz,The first time I met Danny he was my 251 TA and he was helping me learn with command line.  I thought he had some issues to sort out for how much he was swearing
Max Kerr,That's like almost as many real words as swear words. If we count 2...
